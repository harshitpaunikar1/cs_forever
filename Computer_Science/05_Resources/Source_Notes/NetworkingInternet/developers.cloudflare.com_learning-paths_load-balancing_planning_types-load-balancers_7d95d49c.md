# Types of load balancers

With Cloudflare, you can choose between three types of load balancers:

[Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)](https://developers.cloudflare.com#layer-7-load-balancing)(most common)[DNS-only](https://developers.cloudflare.com#dns-only-load-balancing)[Layer 4 (TCP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com#layer-4-load-balancing)

Layer 7 load balancers direct traffic to specific endpoints based on information present in each HTTP/HTTPS request (HTTP headers, URI, cookies, type of data, etc.).

When a client visits your application, Cloudflare directs their request to a healthy endpoint (determined by your [traffic steering policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/) and [endpoint weights](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/origin-level-steering/#weights)).

Cloudflare performs layer 7 load balancing when traffic to your hostname is **proxied** through Cloudflare. In the **Load Balancing** dashboard, these load balancers are marked with an orange cloud.

Note that if a [DNS-only (grey cloud)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/) CNAME record points to a proxied load balancer, the IP returned for it would be endpoint IP and a HTTP request sent to it would not be proxied.

In comparison to DNS-only load balancing, layer 7 load balancing:

- Protects endpoints from DDoS attacks by hiding their IP addresses.
- Offers faster failover and more accurate routing, which can otherwise be affected by DNS caching.
- Integrates with other Cloudflare features such as caching, Workers, and the WAF.
- Reduces authoritative queries against Cloudflare, which can potentially save money for customers with usage-based billing.
- Supports customized
[session affinity](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/)and[endpoint drain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/#endpoint-drain). - More accurately geo-locates traffic, using the data center associated with the user making the request instead of the data center associated with a user's recursive resolver.
- Supports private IP addresses with
[Private Network Load Balancing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/private-network/).

DNS-only load balancers route traffic by returning specific IP addresses in response to a client's DNS query.

When a client visits your application, Cloudflare provides the address for a healthy endpoint (determined by your [traffic steering policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/) and [endpoint-level steering policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/origin-level-steering/)). However, Cloudflare relies on DNS resolvers respecting the short TTL to re-query Cloudflare's DNS for an updated list of healthy addresses. If a client has a cached DNS response, they will go to their previous destination, potentially ignoring your load balancer.

Cloudflare performs DNS-only load balancing when traffic to your hostname is **not proxied** through Cloudflare. In the **Load Balancing** dashboard, these load balancers are marked with a gray cloud.

If your load balancer is attached to a hostname used for an [ MX or SRV record](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/additional-dns-records/) â and not an

`A`

, `AAAA`

, or `CNAME`

record â its proxy mode should be **DNS-only**.

In comparison to proxied, layer 7 load balancing, DNS-only load balancing:

- Does not hide the IP addresses of your endpoints, leaving them vulnerable to DDoS attacks.
- Performs slower failover and less accurate routing, because it has to rely on DNS resolvers and cache settings.
- Cannot integrate with other Cloudflare features such as caching, Workers, and the WAF.
- Increases authoritative queries against Cloudflare, which can potentially cost more for customers with usage-based billing.
- Does not support
[session affinity](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/session-affinity/). Alternatively, you can use[DNS persistence](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/additional-options/dns-persistence/). - Geo-locates traffic based on the data center associated with the ECS source address, if available. If not available, geo-locates based on a user's recursive resolver, which can sometimes cause issues with
[latency-based steering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/steering-policies/dynamic-steering/). - Does not support
[Private Network Load Balancing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/private-network/).

Layer 4 load balancers route traffic by forwarding traffic to certain ports or IP addresses.

Cloudflare currently only supports layer 4 load balancing as part of [Cloudflare Spectrum](https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/about/load-balancer/).
