Abstract
Distributed systems are notorious for harboring subtle bugs.
Veriﬁcation can, in principle, eliminate these bugs a priori,
but veriﬁcation has historically been difﬁcult to apply at full-
program scale, much less distributed-system scale.
We describe a methodology for building practical and
provably correct distributed systems based on a unique blend
of TLA-style state-machine reﬁnement and Hoare-logic ver-
iﬁcation. We demonstrate the methodology on a complex
implementation of a Paxos-based replicated state machine
library and a lease-based sharded key-value store. We prove
that each obeys a concise safety speciﬁcation, as well as de-
sirable liveness requirements. Each implementation achieves
performance competitive with a reference system. With our
methodology and lessons learned, we aim to raise the stan-
dard for distributed systems from “tested” to “correct.”
1. Introduction
Distributed systems are notoriously hard to get right. Protocol
designers struggle to reason about concurrent execution on
multiple machines, which leads to subtle errors. Engineers
implementing such protocols face the same subtleties and,
worse, must improvise to ﬁll in gaps between abstract proto-
col descriptions and practical constraints, e.g., that real logs
cannot grow without bound. Thorough testing is considered
best practice, but its efﬁcacy is limited by distributed systems’
combinatorially large state spaces.
In theory, formal veriﬁcation can categorically eliminate
errors from distributed systems. However, due to the com-
plexity of these systems, previous work has primarily fo-
cused on formally specifying [ 4, 13, 27, 41, 48, 64], verify-
ing [3, 52, 53, 59, 61], or at least bug-checking [20, 31, 69]
distributed protocols, often in a simpliﬁed form, without
extending such formal reasoning to the implementations.
In principle, one can use model checking to reason about
the correctness of both protocols [ 42, 59] and implemen-
tations [46, 47, 69]. In practice, however, model checking
is incomplete—the accuracy of the results depends on the
accuracy of the model—and does not scale [4].

This paper presents IronFleet, the ﬁrst methodology for
automated machine-checked veriﬁcation of the safety and
liveness of non-trivial distributed system implementations.
The IronFleet methodology is practical: it supports complex,
feature-rich implementations with reasonable performance
and a tolerable proof burden.
Ultimately, IronFleet guarantees that the implementation
of a distributed system meets a high-level, centralized spec-
iﬁcation. For example, a sharded key-value store acts like
a key-value store, and a replicated state machine acts like
a state machine. This guarantee categorically rules out race
conditions, violations of global invariants, integer overﬂow,
disagreements between packet encoding and decoding, and
bugs in rarely exercised code paths such as failure recov-
ery [70]. Moreover, it not only rules out bad behavior, it tells
us exactly how the distributed system will behave at all times.
The IronFleet methodology supports proving both safety
and liveness properties of distributed system implementa-
tions. A safety property says that the system cannot perform
incorrect actions; e.g., replicated-state-machine linearizabil-
ity says that clients never see inconsistent results. A liveness
property says that the system eventually performs a useful
action, e.g., that it eventually responds to each client request.
In large-scale deployments, ensuring liveness is critical, since
a liveness bug may render the entire system unavailable.
IronFleet takes the veriﬁcation of safety properties further
than prior work (§9), mechanically verifying two full-featured
systems. The veriﬁcation applies not just to their protocols
but to actual imperative implementations that achieve good
performance. Our proofs reason all the way down to the
bytes of the UDP packets sent on the network, guaranteeing
correctness despite packet drops, reorderings, or duplications.
Regarding liveness, IronFleet breaks new ground: to our
knowledge, IronFleet is the ﬁrst system to mechanically
verify liveness properties of a practical protocol, let alone an
implementation.
IronFleet achieves comprehensive veriﬁcation of complex
distributed systems via a methodology for structuring and
writing proofs about them, as well as a collection of generic
veriﬁed libraries useful for implementing such systems. Struc-
turally, IronFleet’s methodology uses a concurrency contain-
ment strategy (§3) that blends two distinct veriﬁcation styles
within the same automated theorem-proving framework, pre-
venting any semantic gaps between them. We use TLA-style
state-machine reﬁnement [36] to reason about protocol-level
concurrency, ignoring implementation complexities, then use
Floyd-Hoare-style imperative veriﬁcation [17, 22] to reason

about those complexities while ignoring concurrency. To
simplify reasoning about concurrency, we impose a machine-
checked reduction-enabling obligation on the implementa-
tion (§3.6). Finally, we structure our protocols using always-
enabled actions (§4.2) to greatly simplify liveness proofs.
To facilitate writing proofs about distributed systems, we
have developed techniques for writing automation-friendly in-
variant proofs (§3.3), as well as disciplines and tool improve-
ments for coping with prover limitations (§6). For liveness
proofs, we have constructed an embedding of TLA (§4.1) in
our automated veriﬁcation framework that includes heuristics
for reliably unleashing the power of automated proving.
To help developers, we have built general-purpose veriﬁed
libraries for common tasks, such as packet parsing and
marshalling, relating concrete data structures to their abstract
counterparts, and reasoning about collections. We have also
written a veriﬁed library of 40 fundamental TLA rules useful
for writing liveness proofs.
To illustrate IronFleet’s applicability, we have built and
proven correct two rather different distributed systems:
IronRSL, a Paxos-based [ 35] replicated-state-machine li-
brary, and IronKV, a sharded key-value store. All IronFleet
code is publicly available [25].
IronRSL’s implementation is complex, including many de-
tails often omitted by prior work; e.g., it supports state trans-
fer, log truncation, dynamic view-change timeouts, batching,
and a reply cache. We prove complete functional correctness
and its key liveness property: if the network is eventually
synchronous for a live quorum of replicas, then a client re-
peatedly submitting a request eventually receives a reply.
Unlike IronRSL, which uses distribution for reliability,
IronKV uses it for improved throughput by moving “hot”
keys to dedicated machines. For IronKV, we prove complete
functional correctness and an important liveness property: if
the network is fair then the reliable-transmission component
eventually delivers each message.
While veriﬁcation rules out a host of problems, it is not
a panacea (§8). IronFleet’s correctness is not absolute; it
relies on several assumptions (§2.5). Additionally, veriﬁcation
requires more up-front development effort: the automated
tools we use ﬁll in many low-level proof steps automatically
(§6.3.1), but still require considerable assistance from the
developer (§6.3.2). Finally, we focus on verifying newly
written code in a veriﬁcation-friendly language (§2.2), rather
than verifying existing code.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
• We demonstrate the feasibility of mechanically verify-
ing that practical distributed implementations, i.e., func-
tionally complete systems with reasonable performance,
match simple, logically centralized speciﬁcations.
• We describe IronFleet’s novel methodology for uniting
TLA-style reﬁnement with Floyd-Hoare logic within a
single automated veriﬁcation framework.
• We provide the ﬁrst machine-veriﬁed liveness proofs of
non-trivial distributed systems.

fying distributed systems.
2. Background and Assumptions
We brieﬂy describe the existing veriﬁcation techniques that
IronFleet draws upon, as well as our assumptions.
2.1 State Machine Reﬁnement
State machine reﬁnement [1, 18, 34] is often used to rea-
son about distributed systems [ 4, 27, 41, 48, 52, 64]. The
developer describes the desired system as a simple abstract
state machine with potentially inﬁnitely many states and non-
deterministic transition predicates. She then creates a series
of increasingly complex (but still declarative) state machines,
and proves that each one reﬁnes the one “above” it (Figure 1).
State machine L reﬁnesH if each of L’s possible behaviors,
i.e., each (potentially inﬁnite) sequence of states the machine
may visit, corresponds to an equivalent behavior of H. To
gain the beneﬁts of abstraction this approach provides, the
developer must choose the layer abstractions intelligently, a
subtle choice needed for each new context.
State machine reﬁnement in a distributed-system context
(e.g., TLA-style reﬁnement) typically considers declarative
speciﬁcations, not imperative code. PlusCal [37] attempts to
bridge this gap, but has only been used for tiny programs.
2.2 Floyd-Hoare Veriﬁcation
Many program veriﬁcation tools support Floyd-Hoare style [17,
22] ﬁrst-order predicate logic reasoning about imperative pro-
grams. In other words, they allow the programmer to annotate
a program with assertions about the program’s state, and the
veriﬁer checks that the assertions hold true for all possible
program inputs. For example, the code in Figure 2 asserts
a condition about its input via a precondition and asserts a
condition about its output via a postcondition.
As in our previous work [21], we use Dafny [39], a high-
level language that automates veriﬁcation via the Z3 [ 11]
SMT solver. This enables it to ﬁll in many low-level proofs

automatically; for example, it easily veriﬁes the program in
Figure 2 for all possible inputs x without any assistance.
However, many proposition classes are not decidable in
general, so Z3 uses heuristics. For example, propositions
involving universal quantiﬁers (∀) and existential quantiﬁers
(∃) are undecidable. Thus, it is possible to write correct
code in Dafny that the solver nevertheless cannot prove
automatically. Instead, the developer may insert annotations
to guide the veriﬁer’s heuristics to a proof. For instance, the
developer can write a trigger to cue the veriﬁer as to which
values to instantiate a quantiﬁed variable with [12].
Once a program veriﬁes, Dafny compiles it to C# and has
the .NET compiler produce an executable. Other languages
(e.g., C++) are currently unsupported, but it would likely be
possible to compile Dafny to them. Our previous work [21]
shows how to compile Dafny to veriﬁable assembly to avoid
depending on the Dafny compiler, .NET, and Windows.
Like most veriﬁcation tools, Dafny only considers one
single-threaded program, not a collection of concurrently
executing hosts. Indeed, some veriﬁcation experts estimate
that the state-of-the-art in concurrent program veriﬁcation
lags that of sequential veriﬁcation by a decade [51].
2.3 Reduction
Given a ﬁne-grained behavior from a real concurrent system,
we can use reduction [40] to convert it to an equivalent
behavior of coarse-grained steps, simplifying veriﬁcation.
Crucially, two steps can swap places in the behavior if
swapping them has no effect on the execution’s outcome.
Reduction is typically used in the context of shared-
memory concurrent programs [9, 14, 33] and synchronization
primitives [65]. Applying reduction requires identifying all of
the steps in the system, proving commutativity relationships
among them, and applying these relationships to create an
equivalent behavior with a more useful form. We tackle these
challenges in the context of distributed systems in§3.6.
2.4 Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA)
Temporal logic [54] and its extension TLA [34] are standard
tools for reasoning about safety and liveness. Temporal logic
formulas are predicates about the system’s current and future
states. The simplest type of formula ignores the future; e.g.,
in a lock system, a formula P could be “host h holds the lock
now.” Other formulas involve the future; e.g., ♦P means P
eventually holds, and □P means P holds now and forever.
For example, the property∀h∈ Hosts : □♦P means that for
any host, it is always true that h will eventually hold the lock.
TLA typically considers abstract speciﬁcations, not im-
perative code. Furthermore, a na¨ıve embedding of TLA can
often pose problems for automated veriﬁcation. After all,
each □ involves a universal quantiﬁer and each♦ involves
an existential quantiﬁer. Since Z3 needs heuristics to decide
propositions with quantiﬁers (§2.2), it can fail due to inade-
quate developer annotations. We address this in§4.1.

Figure 3. Veriﬁcation Overview. IronFleet divides a distributed
system into carefully chosen layers. We use TLA style veriﬁcation to
prove that any behavior of the protocol layer (e.g., P0. . .P3) reﬁnes
some behavior of the high-level spec (e.g., H0. . .H4). We then use
Floyd-Hoare style to prove that any behavior of the implementation
(e.g., I0. . .I3) reﬁnes a behavior of the protocol layer.
2.5 Assumptions
Our guarantees rely on the following assumptions.
A small amount of our code is assumed, rather than proven,
correct. Thus, to trust the system, a user must read this code.
Speciﬁcally, the spec for each system is trusted, as is the brief
main-event loop described in§3.7.
We do not assume reliable delivery of packets, so the
network may arbitrarily delay, drop, or duplicate packets. We
do assume the network does not tamper with packets, and
that the addresses in packet headers are trustworthy. These
assumptions about message integrity are easy to enforce
within, say, a datacenter or VPN, and could be relaxed by
modeling the necessary cryptographic primitives to talk about
keys instead of addresses [21].
We assume the correctness of Dafny, the .NET compiler
and runtime, and the underlying Windows OS. Previous
work [21] shows how to compile Dafny code into veriﬁable
assembly code to avoid these dependencies. We also rely on
the correctness of the underlying hardware.
Our liveness properties depend on further assumptions. For
IronRSL, we assume a quorum of replicas run their respective
main loops with a minimum frequency, never running out
of memory, and the network eventually delivers messages
synchronously among them; more details are in§5.1.4. For
IronKV, we assume that each host’s main loop executes
inﬁnitely often and that the network is fair, i.e., a message
sent inﬁnitely often is eventually delivered.
3. The IronFleet Veriﬁcation Methodology
IronFleet organizes a distributed system’s implementation
and proof into layers (Figure 3) to avoid the intermingling of
subtle distributed protocols with implementation complexity.
At the top (§3.1), we write a simple spec for the system’s
behavior. We then write an abstract distributed protocol layer
(§3.2) and use TLA-style techniques to prove that it reﬁnes
the spec layer (§3.3). Then we write an imperative implemen-
tation layer to run on each host (§3.4) and prove that, despite
the complexities introduced when writing real systems code,
the implementation correctly reﬁnes the protocol layer (§3.5).
To avoid complex reasoning about interleaved execution of
low-level operations at multiple hosts, we use a concurrency

datatype SpecState = SpecState(history:seq<HostId>)
predicate SpecInit (ss:SpecState)
{ |ss.history|==1 && ss.history[0] in AllHostIds () }
predicate SpecNext (ss_old:SpecState,ss_new:SpecState)
{ exists new_holder :: new_holder in AllHostIds () &&
ss_new.history == ss_old.history + [new_holder] }
predicate SpecRelation (is:ImplState,ss:SpecState)
{ forall p :: p in is.sentPackets && p.msg.lock? ==>
p.src == ss.history[p.msg.epoch] }
Figure 4. A toy lock speciﬁcation.
containment strategy: the proofs above assume that every
implementation step performs an atomic protocol step. Since
the real implementation’s execution is not atomic, we use
a reduction argument (§3.6) to show that a proof assuming
atomicity is equally valid as a proof for the real system. This
argument requires a mechanically veriﬁed property of the
implementation, as well as a small paper-only proof about
the implications of the property.
§4 extends this methodology to prove liveness properties.
3.1 The High-Level Spec Layer
What does it mean for a system to be correct? One can
informally enumerate a set of properties and hope they are
sufﬁcient to provide correctness. A more rigorous way is
to deﬁne a spec, a succinct description of every allowable
behavior of the system, and prove that an implementation
always generates outputs consistent with the spec.
With IronFleet, the developer writes the system’s spec
as a state machine: starting with some initial state, the spec
succinctly describes how that state can be transformed. The
spec deﬁnes the state machine via threepredicates, i.e., func-
tions that return true or false. SpecInit describes accept-
able starting states, SpecNext describes acceptable ways
to move from an old to a new state, and SpecRelation
describes the required conditions on the relation between an
implementation state and its corresponding abstract state. For
instance, in Figure 3, SpecInit constrains what H0 can be,
SpecNext constrains steps like H0→H1 and H1→H2, and
SpecRelation constrains corresponding state pairs like
(I1, H1) and (I2, H4). To avoid unnecessary constraints on im-
plementations of the spec, SpecRelation should only talk
about the externally visible behavior of the implementation,
e.g., the set of messages it has sent so far.
As a toy example, the spec in Figure 4 describes a simple
distributed lock service with a single lock that passes amongst
the hosts. It deﬁnes the system’s state as a history: a sequence
of host IDs such that the nth host in the sequence held the
lock in epoch n. Initially, this history contains one valid host.
The system can step from an old to a new state by appending
a valid host to the history. An implementation is consistent
with the spec if all lock messages for epoch n come from the
nth host in the history.
By keeping the spec simple, a skeptic can study the spec
to understand the system’s properties. In our example, she
can easily conclude that the lock is never held by more
datatype Host = Host(held:bool,epoch:int)
predicate HostInit (s:Host,id:HostId,held:bool)
{ s.held==held && s.epoch==0 }
predicate HostGrant (s_old:Host,s_new:Host,
spkt:Packet) {
{ s_old.held && !s_new.held && spkt.msg.transfer?
&& spkt.msg.epoch == s_old.epoch+1 }
predicate HostAccept (s_old:Host,s_new:Host,
rpkt:Packet,spkt:Packet)
{ !s_old.held && s_new.held && rpkt.msg.transfer?
&& s_new.epoch == rpkt.msg.epoch == spkt.msg.epoch
&& spkt.msg.lock? }
predicate HostNext (s_old:Host,s_new:Host,
rpkt:Packet,spkt:Packet)
{ HostGrant(s_old,s_new,spkt) ||
HostAccept(s_old,s_new,rpkt,spkt) }

than one host. Since the spec captures all permitted system
behaviors, she can later verify additional properties of the
implementation just by verifying they are implied by the spec.
3.2 The Distributed-Protocol Layer
At the untrusted distributed-protocol layer, the IronFleet
methodology introduces the concept of independent hosts
that communicate only via network messages. To manage
this new complexity, we keep this layer simple and abstract.
In more detail, we formally specify, in Dafny (§2.2), a dis-
tributed system state machine. This state machine consists of
N host state machines and a collection of network packets. In
each step of the distributed system state machine, one host’s
state machine takes a step, allowing it to atomically read mes-
sages from the network, update its state, and send messages
to the network;§3.6 relaxes this atomicity assumption.
The developer must specify each host’s state machine: the
structure of the host’s local state, how that state is initialized
(HostInit), and how it is updated (HostNext). IronFleet
reduces the developer’s effort in the following three ways.
First, we use a simple, abstract style for the host state and
network interface; e.g., the state uses unbounded mathemati-
cal integers (ignoring overﬂow issues), unbounded sequences
of values (e.g., tracking all messages ever sent or received),
and immutable types (ignoring memory management and
heap aliasing). The network allows hosts to send and receive
high-level, structured packets, hence excluding the challenges
of marshalling and parsing from this layer.
Second, we use a declarative predicate style. In other
words, HostNext merely describes how host state can
change during each step; it gives no details about how to effect
those changes, let alone how to do so with good performance.
Third, from the protocol’s perspective, each of the steps
deﬁned above takes place atomically, greatly simplifying the
proof that the protocol reﬁnes the spec layer (§3.3). In§3.6,
we connect this proof assuming atomicity to a real execution.
Continuing our lock example, the protocol layer might
deﬁne a host state machine as in Figure 5. During the dis-
tributed system’s initialization of each host via HostInit,
exactly one host is given the lock via the held parameter.

The HostNext predicate then says that a host may step
from an old to a new state if the new state is the result of
one of two actions, each represented by its own predicate.
The two actions are giving away the lock (HostGrant) and
receiving the lock from another host (HostAccept). A host
may grant the lock if in the old state it holds the lock, and
if in the new state it no longer holds it, and if the outbound
packet (spkt) represents a transfer message to another host.
Accepting a lock is analogous.
3.3 Connecting the Protocol Layer to the Spec Layer
The ﬁrst major theorem we prove about each system is that
the distributed protocol layer reﬁnes the high-level spec layer.
In other words, given a behavior of IronFleet’s distributed
system in which N hosts take atomic protocol steps deﬁned
by the HostNext predicate, we provide a corresponding
behavior of the high-level state machine spec.
We use the standard approach to proving reﬁnement, as
illustrated in Figure 3. First, we deﬁne areﬁnement function
PRef that takes a state of the distributed protocol state
machine and returns the corresponding state of the centralized
spec. We could use a relation instead of a function, but the
proof is easier with a function [ 1]. Second, we prove that
PRef of the initial state of the distributed protocol satisﬁes
SpecInit. Third, we prove that if a step of the protocol
takes the state from ps_old to ps_new, then there exists
a legal sequence of high-level spec steps that goes from
PRef(ps_old) to PRef(ps_new).
Unlike previous reﬁnement-based work (§2.1), we use a
language, Dafny [39], designed for automated theorem prov-
ing. This reduces but does not eliminate the human proof
effort required (§6.3). Since we also verify our implementa-
tion in Dafny (§3.5), we avoid any semantic gaps between
the implementation’s view of the protocol and the protocol
we actually prove correct.
The challenge of proving the protocol-to-spec theorem
comes from reasoning about global properties of the dis-
tributed system. One key tool is to establish invariants: pred-
icates that should hold throughout the execution of the dis-
tributed protocol. In the lock example, we might use the
invariant that the lock is either held by exactly one host or
granted by one in-ﬂight lock-transfer message. We can prove
this invariant inductively by showing that every protocol step
preserves it. Showing reﬁnement of the spec is then simple.
Identifying the right invariants for a given protocol re-
quires a deep understanding of the protocol, but it is a skill
one develops with experience (§6).
Invariant quantiﬁer hiding. Many useful invariants, like
“For every reply message sent, there exists a corresponding
request message sent,” involve quantiﬁers. Unfortunately,
such quantiﬁers pose problems for veriﬁers (§2.2). We have
thus adopted a style we call invariant quantiﬁer hiding: we
prove some invariants involving quantiﬁers without explicitly
exposing those quantiﬁers to the veriﬁer. The key is to
establish the invariant with a proof that explicitly instantiates
lemma ReplyToReq (reply:MessageReply,
behavior:map<int,HostState>, step: nat)
returns (req:MessageRequest)
requires IsValidBehaviorUpTo (behavior, step);
requires reply in behavior[step].network;
ensures req in behavior[step].network;
ensures Matches (req, reply);
{
assert step > 0; // because a packet was sent
if !(reply in behavior[step-1].network) {
req := OnlyExecReplies(behavior, step-1);
} else { // apply induction
req := ReplyToReq(behavior, step-1, reply);
}
}
Figure 6. Establishing an invariant with implicit quantiﬁers.
all bound variables. For each universal quantiﬁer in the
invariant that does not succeed an existential quantiﬁer, the
quantiﬁed variable is an input parameter of the proof. For each
existential quantiﬁer in the invariant, the quantiﬁed variable
is an output parameter. For instance, the invariant from the
beginning of this paragraph could be proved with Figure 6.
It is easy to write this proof because we must prove it only
for a speciﬁc reply message, not all of them. As illustrated
above, there are only two cases to consider: (1) the reply
message was just generated, in which case we only have to
consider the last action taken, or (2) the reply message was
already present in the previous step, in which case we can
complete the proof by induction on step.
It is also easy to use this proof because instead of stating
a fact about the existence of a request message, it explicitly
provides a witness to that existence. Typically, a developer
only needs to prove the invariant for a speciﬁc reply message;
this form lets her establish precisely that fact. If the developer
needs the universally-quantiﬁed version, she can establish it
by invoking the invariant’s proof in a loop.
3.4 The Implementation Layer
Unlike in the declarative protocol layer, in the implementation
layer the developer writes single-threaded, imperative code
to run on each host. This code must cope with all of the
ugly practicalities we abstracted away in the protocol layer.
For instance, it must handle real-world constraints on how
hosts interact: since network packets must be bounded-sized
byte arrays, we need to prove the correctness of our routines
for marshalling high-level data structures into bytes and for
parsing those bytes. We also write the implementation with
performance in mind, e.g., using mutable arrays instead of
immutable sequences and using uint64s instead of inﬁnite-
precision integers. The latter requires us to prove the system
correct despite the potential for integer overﬂow.
Dafny does not natively support networking, so we extend
the language with a trusted UDP speciﬁcation that exposes
Init, Send, and Receive methods. For example, Send
expects an IP address and port for the destination and an
array of bytes for the message body. When compiled, calls to

these Dafny methods invoke the .NET UDP network stack.
Send also automatically inserts the host’s correct IP address,
satisfying our assumption about packet headers in§2.5.
The network interface maintains a ghost variable (i.e., a
variable used only for veriﬁcation, not execution) that records
a “journal” of every Send and Receive that takes place,
including all of the arguments and return values. We use this
journal when proving properties of the implementation (§3.5).
3.5 Connecting the Implementation to the Protocol
The second major theorem we prove about each IronFleet
system is that the implementation layer correctly reﬁnes the
protocol. To do this, we prove that even though the imple-
mentation operates on concrete local state, which uses heap-
dependent, bounded representations, it is still a reﬁnement
of the protocol layer, which operates on abstract types and
unbounded representations.
First, we prove that the host implementation reﬁnes the
host state machine described in the protocol layer. This reﬁne-
ment proof is analogous to the one in§3.3, though simpliﬁed
by the fact that each step in the implementation corresponds to
exactly one step of the host state machine. We deﬁne a reﬁne-
ment function HRef that maps a host’s implementation state
to a host protocol state. We prove that the code ImplInit
to initialize the host’s state ensures HostInit(HRef(hs)),
and that the codeImplNext to execute one host step ensures
HostNext(HRef(hs_old),HRef(hs_new)).
Then, we use this to prove that a distributed system
comprising N host implementations, i.e., what we actually
intend to run, reﬁnes the distributed protocol of N hosts.
We use a reﬁnement function IRef that maps states of
the distributed implementation to states of the distributed
protocol. The reﬁnement proof is largely straightforward
because each step of the distributed implementation in which
a host executes ImplNext corresponds to one step of the
distributed protocol where a host takes a HostNext step.
The difﬁcult part is proving that the network state in the
distributed system implementation reﬁnes the network state
in the protocol layer. Speciﬁcally, we must prove that every
send or receive of a UDP packet corresponds to a send or
receive of an abstract packet. This involves proving that when
host A marshals a data structure into an array of bytes and
sends it to host B, B parses out the identical data structure.
The last major theorem we prove is that the distributed
implementation reﬁnes the abstract centralized spec. For this,
we use the reﬁnement functions from our two major reﬁne-
ment theorems, composing them to form our ﬁnal reﬁnement
function PRef(IRef(·)). The key part of this proof is
establishing that the speciﬁed relation conditions hold, i.e.,
that for all implementation states is, SpecRelation(is,
IRef(PRef(is))) holds.
3.6 Abstracting Non-Atomicity via Reduction
Sections 3.1–3.5 describe a mechanically veriﬁed proof struc-
ture that assumes that every implementation step performs an

Figure 7. Reduction. In the real execution behavior, the send
(S), receive (R), and local processing (P) steps at hosts A and B
are fully interleaved. However, certain steps commute to yield an
equivalent behavior. Since we impose constraints on the structure
of the implementation’s event handlers (Figure 8), we can commute
steps until all of the implementation-level steps in a given host’s
event handler (circled) are contiguous. This reduced behavior then
admits a direct reﬁnement to the distributed protocol layer.
atomic protocol step. However, the implementation’s event
handler is not atomic: while one host receives packets, com-
putes locally, and sends packets, other hosts do the same con-
currently, leading to arbitrary interleavings of these low-level
operations. To bridge this gap, we use a “reduction” argument
(§2.3). Reduction is typically used to reason about threads
and processes sharing a single machine, but we apply it to rea-
soning about distributed systems. Although Dafny does not
provide a general mechanism for reasoning about reduction,
we are still able to use Dafny to enforce an obligation on the
implementation that enables reduction. A machine-checked
proof that this obligation enables reduction is future work;
instead, we sketch an informal argument here.
Hosts are unable to see others’ state except indirectly by
observing the packets they send. Thus, it is possible to take a
behavior of the system, representing the order in which events
really occurred, and posit an alternate order in which (1) each
host receives the same packets in the same order, (2) packet
send ordering is preserved, (3) packets are never received
before they are sent, and (4) the ordering of operations on
any individual host is preserved. Any proof of correctness
assuming such an ordering implies a proof for the original
behavior, since only the externalized behavior of the system,
the content and ordering messages sent, matters.
Figure 7 shows an example of such reordering. We start
with the real behavior at the bottom and reorder until we reach
the behavior at the top. For instance, we can reorder A’s ﬁrst
send before B’s ﬁrst receive because we know its contents
cannot have depended on B’s receive. The top behavior has no
interleavings between different hosts’ HostNext steps, and
thus is a legal behavior in which we have proved correctness.
Thus, the correctness proof also applies to the real behavior.
As a result, we can always reduce a real execution behavior
to a sequence of atomic steps via such reorderings if we
constrain the implementation to, in any given step, perform
all of its receives before all its sends. We call this areduction-
enabling obligation, which we use Dafny to enforce (§3.7).
With this obligation, we ensure that our proof of correctness

method Main () {
var s := ImplInit();
while (true)
invariant ImplInvariant (s);
{
ghost var journal_old := get_event_journal();
ghost var ios_performed:seq<IoEvent>;
s, ios_performed := ImplNext(s);
assert get_event_journal() ==
journal_old + ios_performed;
assert ReductionObligation (ios_performed);
}
}
Figure 8. Mandatory host event-handler loop.
assuming atomicity is equally valid as a proof of correctness
for the real system.
One complication is that when a host performs a time-
dependent operation like reading its clock, it creates a causal
constraint even without communication with other hosts.
This is because the clock represents an imperfect sample
from a globally shared reality. Thus, the reduction-enabling
obligation is extended as follows: A step may perform at
most one time-dependent operation, i.e., at most one clock
read, blocking receive, or non-blocking receive that returns
no packets. The step must perform all receives before this
time-dependent operation, and all sends after it.
3.7 Trusted Code
Nearly all IronFleet code is veriﬁed using the above methodol-
ogy, so there are only a few lines of code and proof assertions
that a user must read to gain conﬁdence in the system. First,
she must read the high-level centralized spec to understand
what is being guaranteed. Second, she must read the asser-
tion, but not the proof of the assertion, that if each host in
a distributed system runs ImplInit followed by a loop of
ImplNext, then there exists a corresponding abstract behav-
ior of the centralized spec. Third, she must read the top-level
main host routine (Figure 8) to convince herself that each
host runs ImplInit and ImplNext. This code also ensures
that each host step meets its reduction-enabling constraint by
using the journal of externally visible events from§3.4.
4. Verifying Liveness
§3 describes the high-level spec as a state machine. Such a
spec says what the implementation must not do: it must never
deviate from the state machine’s behavior. However, it is also
useful to specify what the implementationmust do; properties
of this form are called liveness properties. For example, we
might specify that the lock implementation eventually grants
the lock to each host (Figure 9). Thus, a spec will typically
include not just a state machine but also liveness properties.
Some researchers have proposed heuristics for detecting
and quashing likely sources of liveness violations [ 31, 66],
but it is better to deﬁnitivelyprove their absence. With such
a proof, we do not have to reason about, e.g., deadlock or
predicate LockBehaviorFair (b:map<int,SpecState>)
{ forall h:Host, i: int :: h in AllHostIds () && i >= 0
==> exists j :: j >= i && h == last(b[j].history) }
Figure 9. Desired liveness property for the lock service.
livelock; such conditions and any others that can prevent the
system from making progress are provably ruled out.
Liveness properties are much harder to verify than safety
properties. Safety proofs need only reason about two system
states at a time: if each step between two states preserves the
system’s safety invariants, then we can inductively conclude
that all behaviors are safe. Liveness, in contrast, requires
reasoning about inﬁnite series of system states. Such reason-
ing creates challenges for automated theorem provers (§2.4),
often causing the prover to time out rather than return a suc-
cessful veriﬁcation or a useful error message.
With IronFleet, we address these challenges via a custom
TLA embedding in Dafny that focuses the prover’s efforts
in fruitful directions. We then use our TLA embedding to
build a library of fundamental TLA proof rules veriﬁed from
ﬁrst principles. This library is a useful artifact for proving
liveness properties of arbitrary distributed systems: its rules
allow both the human developer and Dafny to operate at a
high level by taking large proof steps with a single call to a
lemma from the library. Finally, by structuring our protocols
with always-enabled actions, we signiﬁcantly simplify the
task of proving liveness properties.
4.1 TLA Embedding and Library
As discussed in §2.4, TLA [ 34] is a standard tool for rea-
soning about liveness. IronFleet embeds TLA in Dafny by
modeling a TLA behavior, an inﬁnite sequence of system
states, as a mapping B from integers to states, where B[0] is
the initial state and B[i] is the ith subsequent state. A liveness
property is a constraint on the behavior of the state machine.
For example, Figure 9 says that for every host h, there is
always a later time when h will hold the lock.
Our embedding hides key deﬁnitions from the prover
except where truly needed, and instead provides veriﬁed
lemmas that relate them to one another. For example, we
represent temporal logic formulas as opaque objects (i.e.,
objects Dafny knows nothing about) of type temporal,
and TLA transformations like □ as functions that convert
temporal objects to temporal objects.
Of course, in some contexts we actually do need to reason
about the internal meaning of □ and ♦. State-of-the-art SMT
solvers like Z3 do not yet provide decision procedures for
temporal operators like □ and ♦ directly. However, we can
encode these operators using explicit quantiﬁcation over
steps (□ universally quantiﬁes over all future steps, while
♦ existentially quantiﬁes over some future step). We can
then provide the SMT solver with heuristics to control these
quantiﬁers using the solver’s support for triggers [ 12], as
discussed in§2.2. One simple heuristic proved effective in
many situations: when the solver is considering a future

step j for one formula, such as ♦Q, the heuristic requests
that the solver also consider j as a candidate step for other
formulas starting with □ or ♦, such as □P and ♦(P∧ Q).
This allows the solver to automatically prove formulas like
(♦Q)∧ (□P) =⇒ ♦(P∧ Q).
This heuristic is effective enough to automatically prove
40 fundamental TLA proof rules, i.e., rules for deriving one
formula from other formulas [ 34]. The heuristic allows us
to prove complicated rules efﬁciently; e.g., we stated and
proved Lamport’s INV1 rule about invariants in only 27 lines
of Dafny, and his WF1 rule about fairness in only 16 lines.
Our liveness proofs use these fundamental proof-rule
lemmas to justify temporal formula transformations. For
instance, as we discuss in§4.4, a liveness proof can usually
prove most of its steps by repeatedly invoking the WF1 rule.
4.2 Always-Enabled Actions
To achieve liveness, our protocol must satisfy fairness
properties. That is, it must ensure that each action, e.g.,
HostGrant or HostAccept, occurs in a timely fashion.
Lamport [36] suggests that such properties take the form
“if action A becomes always enabled, i.e., always possible
to do, the implementation must eventually do it.” However,
having terms of this form in veriﬁed code is problematic. If
the fairness property is a complex formula, it can be difﬁcult
to characterize the set of states from which the action is
possible. This difﬁculty complicates both proving that the
fairness property is sufﬁcient to ensure liveness properties,
and proving that the protocol has the fairness property.
Thus, we instead adopt always-enabled actions; i.e., we
only use actions that are always possible to do. For instance,
we would not use HostGrant from Figure 5 since it is
impossible to perform if you do not hold the lock. Instead,
we might use “if you hold the lock, grant it to the next host;
otherwise, do nothing”, which can always be done.
Our approach deviates from Lamport’s standard fairness
formulas, which means it can admit speciﬁcations that are not
machine closed [36]. Machine closure ensures that liveness
conditions do not combine with safety conditions to create
an unimplementable spec, such as that the implementation
must both grant a lock (to be fair) and not grant a lock
(to be safe, because it does not hold the lock). Fortunately,
machine closure is no concern in IronFleet: the existence
of an implementation that meets a fairness property is itself
proof that the property does not prevent implementation!
4.3 Proving Fairness Properties
Following IronFleet’s general philosophy of having the imple-
mentation layer deal only with implementation complexities,
we put the burden of satisfying fairness properties on the
protocol layer. The implementation satisﬁes the properties
automatically since its main method implements HostNext.
The mandatory structure from Figure 8 ensures that
HostNext runs inﬁnitely often. So, all we must prove
is that if HostNext runs inﬁnitely often, then each action
occurs inﬁnitely often. We do this by havingHostNext be
a scheduler that guarantees each action occurs regularly.
One way to do this is to use a simple round-robin scheduler.
We currently have proofs in our library that if HostNext is
a round-robin scheduler that runs inﬁnitely often, then each
action runs inﬁnitely often. Furthermore, if the main host
method runs with frequency F (expressed, e.g., in times per
second), then each of its n actions occurs with frequency F/n.
4.4 Liveness Proof Strategies
Most of a liveness proof involves demonstrating that if some
condition Ci holds then eventually another condition Ci+1
holds. By chaining such proofs together, we can prove that
if some assumed initial condition C0 holds then eventually
some useful condition Cn holds. For instance, in IronRSL,
we prove that if a replica receives a client’s request, it
eventually suspects its current view; if it suspects its current
view, it eventually sends a message to the potential leader
of a succeeding view; and, if the potential leader receives a
quorum of suspicions, it eventually starts the next view.
Most steps in this chain require an application of a variant
of Lamport’s WF1 rule [ 34]. This variant involves a start-
ing condition Ci, an ending condition Ci+1, and an always-
enabled action predicate Action. It states that Ci leads to Ci+1
if the following three requirements are met:
1. If Ci holds, it continues to hold as long as Ci+1 does not.
2. If a transition satisfying Action occurs when Ci holds, it
causes Ci+1 to hold.
3. Transitions satisfying Action occur inﬁnitely often.
We use this in Dafny as follows. Suppose we need a lemma
that shows Ci leads to Ci+1. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the action transition
Action intended to cause this. We then establish each of
requirements 1 and 2 with an invariant proof that considers
only pairs of adjacent steps. We then invoke the proof from
§4.3 that each of the action transitions occurs inﬁnitely often
to establish requirement 3. Finally, having established the
three preconditions for the WF1 lemma from our veriﬁed
library, we call that lemma.
In some cases, we need lemmas from our library that prove
other variants of the WF1 proof rule sound. For instance,
often we must prove that Ci leads to Ci+1 not just eventually
but within a bounded time. For this, we have a variant of
WF1 that proves Ci+1 holds within the inverse of Action’s
frequency. It uses a modiﬁed requirement 3: that Action
occurs with a minimum frequency.
Another useful variant of WF1 is delayed, bounded-time
WF1. It applies when Action only induces Ci+1 after a certain
time t; this is common in systems that rate-limit certain
actions for performance reasons. For instance, to amortize
the cost of agreement, the IronRSL action for proposing
a batch of requests has a timer preventing it from sending
an incomplete batch too soon after the last batch. Delayed,
bounded-time WF1 uses a modiﬁed requirement 2: “IfAction
occurs when Ci holds and the time is≥ t, it causes Ci+1 to

hold.” This variant proves that Ci+1 eventually holds after t
plus the inverse of the action’s frequency.
Sometimes, a liveness proof needs more than a chain of
conditions: it must prove that multiple conditions eventually
hold simultaneously. For instance, in IronRSL we must prove
that a potential leader eventually knows suspicions from every
replica in the quorum at once. For this, we use our temporal
heuristics to prove sound the proof rule: “If every condition
in a set of conditions eventually holds forever, then eventually
all the conditions in the set hold simultaneously forever.” We
also have and use a bounded-time variant of this rule.
5. System Implementation
We use the IronFleet methodology to implement two practical
distributed systems and prove them correct: a Paxos-based
replicated state machine library and a lease-based sharded
key-value store. All IronFleet code is publicly available [25].
5.1 IronRSL: A Replicated State Machine Library
IronRSL replicates a deterministic application on multiple
machines to make that application fault-tolerant. Such repli-
cation is commonly used for services, like Chubby and
Zookeeper [5, 24], on which many other services depend.
Due to these dependencies, correctness bugs in replication
can lead to cascading problems, and liveness bugs can lead
to widespread outages of all dependent services.
IronRSL guarantees safety and liveness without sacriﬁc-
ing complex implementation features necessary to run real
workloads. For instance, it uses batching to amortize the cost
of consensus across multiple requests, log truncation to con-
strain memory usage, responsive view-change timeouts to
avoid hard-coded assumptions about timing, state transfer to
let nodes recover from extended network disconnection, and
a reply cache to avoid unnecessary work.
5.1.1 The High-Level Speciﬁcation
The spec for IronRSL is simply linearizability: it must gen-
erate the same outputs as a system that runs the application
sequentially on a single node. Our implementation achieves
this in the same way typical replicated state machine libraries
do: it runs the application on multiple nodes, and uses the
MultiPaxos [35] consensus protocol to feed the same requests
in the same order to each replica.
5.1.2 The Distributed-Protocol Layer
Protocol. In the protocol layer, each host’s state consists
of four components, based on Lamport’s description of
Paxos [35]: a proposer, an acceptor, a learner, and an executor.
The host’s action predicates include, for instance, proposing a
batch of requests (Figure 10) or sending the local application
state to a host that has fallen behind.
Protocol invariants. The protocol’s key invariant, known as
agreement, is that two learners never decide on different re-
quest batches for the same slot. Establishing this invariant
requires establishing several more invariants about earlier pro-
predicate ExistsProposal (m_set:set<Msg1b>, op: Op)
{ exists p :: p in m_set && op in p.msg.votes }
predicate ProposeBatch (s:Proposer,s’:Proposer)
{ if |s.1bMsgs| < quorumSize then no_op()
else if ExistsProposal (s.1bMsgs,s.nextOp) then
var new_batches := s.proposedBatches[s.nextOp :=
BatchFromHighestBallot(s.1bMsgs, s.nextOp)];
s’ == s[nextOp := s.nextOp + 1]
[proposedBatches := new_batches]
else ... }
Figure 10. A step predicate example from IronRSL (simpliﬁed).
tocol actions. For instance, we prove that ProposeValue
(Figure 10) cannot propose a batch if a different one may
have already been learned. The action’s predicate states that
batches can only be proposed when the host has received
a 1b message from at least f + 1 acceptors. We use this to
prove that this quorum of acceptors intersects with any other
quorum that might have accepted a batch in a previous ballot.
Protocol reﬁnement. After establishing the agreement in-
variant, we prove that executing the sequence of decided
request batches is equivalent to taking steps in the high-level
state machine. One challenge is that multiple replicas execute
the same request batches, but the corresponding high-level
steps must be taken only once. We address this by reﬁning
the distributed system to an abstract state machine that ad-
vances not when a replica executes a request batch but when
a quorum of replicas has voted for the next request batch.
5.1.3 The Implementation Layer
Often, the most difﬁcult part of writing a method to imple-
ment a protocol action is proving that the method has the
appropriate effect on the reﬁned state. For this, IronRSL re-
lies on our generic reﬁnement library (§5.3), which lightens
the programmer’s burden by proving useful properties about
the reﬁnement of common data structures.
Another difﬁculty is that the protocol sometimes describes
the relationship between the host’s pre-action and post-action
state in a non-constructive way. For instance, it says that the
log truncation point should be set to the nth highest number
in a certain set. It describes how to test whether a number
is the nth highest number in a set, but not how to actually
compute such a quantity. Thus, the implementer must write a
method to do this and prove it correct.
Writing and maintaining invariants is also useful in the im-
plementation. Most IronRSL methods need some constraints
on the concrete state they start with. For instance, without
some constraint on the size of the log, we cannot prove that
the method that serializes it can ﬁt the result into a UDP
packet. We incorporate this constraint (and many others) into
an invariant over the concrete state. Each method learns these
properties on entry and must prove them before returning.
Invariants are also a crucial part of performance optimiza-
tion. Consider, for example, theExistsProposal method
in ProposeBatch. A na¨ıve implementation would always
iterate through all votes in all 1b messages, a costly process.

Instead, we augment the host state with an additional variable,
maxOpn, and prove an invariant that no 1b message exceeds
it. Thus, in the common case that s.nextOp ≥ maxOpn,
the implementation need not scan any 1b messages.
5.1.4 IronRSL Liveness
We also prove our implementation is live: if a client repeat-
edly sends a request to all replicas, it eventually receives
a reply. No consensus protocol can be live under arbitrary
conditions [16], so this property must be qualiﬁed by as-
sumptions. We assume there exists a quorum of replicas Q, a
minimum scheduler frequency F, a maximum network delay
∆, a maximum burst sizeB, and a maximum clock errorE, all
possibly unknown to the implementation, such that (1) even-
tually, the scheduler on each replica in Q runs with frequency
at least F, never exhausting memory; (2) eventually, any mes-
sage sent between replicas in Q and/or the client arrive within
∆; (3) eventually, no replica in Q receives packets at an over-
whelming rate, i.e., each receives no more than B packets
per 10B
F + 1 time units; (4) whenever a replica in Q reads its
clock, the reading differs from true global time by at most
E; and (5) no replica in Q ever stops making progress due to
reaching an overﬂow-prevention limit.
Our proof strategy is as follows. First, we use our library’s
round-robin scheduler proofs to prove that our protocol fairly
schedules each action (§4.3). Next, we prove that eventually
no replica in Q has a backlog of packets in its queue, so
thereafter sending a message among replicas in Q leads to
the receiver acting on that message within a certain bound.
Next, using WF1 (§4.4), we prove that if the client’s request
is never executed, then for any time period T , eventually a
replica in Q becomes the undisputed leader for that period.
Finally, using bounded-time WF1 variants (§4.4), we prove
there exists a T such that an undisputed leader can ensure the
request gets executed and responded to within T .
5.2 IronKV: A Sharded Key-Value Store
We also apply the IronFleet methodology to build IronKV,
a system that uses distribution for a completely different
purpose: to scale its throughput by dynamically sharding a
key-value store across a set of nodes.
The high-level spec of IronKV’s state machine is concise:
it is simply a hash table, as shown in Figure 11.
5.2.1 The Distributed-Protocol Layer
Each host’s state consists of a hash table storing a subset
of the key space and a “delegation map” mapping each key
to the host responsible for it. On protocol initialization, one
designated host is responsible for the entire key space; thus,
each host’s delegation map maps every key to that host.
To gain throughput and to relieve hot spots, IronKV allows
an administrator to delegate sequential key ranges (shards) to
other hosts. When a host receives such an order, it sends the
corresponding key-value pairs to the intended recipient and
updates its delegation map to reﬂect the new owner.
type Hashtable = map<Key,Value>
type OptValue = ValuePresent(v:Value) | ValueAbsent
predicate SpecInit (h:Hashtable) { h == map [] }
predicate Set (h:Hashtable,h’:Hashtable,
k:Key, ov: OptValue)
{ h’ == if ov.ValuePresent? then h[k := ov.v]
else map ki | ki in h && ki!=k :: h[ki] }
predicate Get (h:Hashtable,h’:Hashtable,
k:Key, ov: OptValue)
{ h’ == h && ov == if k in h then ValuePresent (h[k])
else ValueAbsent () }
predicate SpecNext (h:Hashtable,h’:Hashtable)
{ exists k, ov :: Set(h,h’,k,ov) || Get(h,h’,k,ov) }
Figure 11. Complete high-level spec for IronKV state machine
If such a message is lost, the protocol layer cannot be
shown to reﬁne the high-level speciﬁcation, since the corre-
sponding key-value pairs vanish. To avoid this, we design
a sequence-number-based reliable-transmission component
that requires each host to acknowledge messages it receives,
track its own set of unacknowledged messages, and period-
ically resend them. The liveness property we prove is that
if the network is fair (i.e., any packet sent inﬁnitely often
is eventually delivered), then any packet submitted to the
reliable-transmission component is eventually received.
The most important invariant for IronKV’s proof is that
every key is claimed either by exactly one host or in-ﬂight
packet. Using this invariant and the exactly-once delivery se-
mantics we prove about our reliable-transmission component,
we show that the protocol layer reﬁnes the high-level spec.
5.2.2 The Implementation Layer
As in IronRSL, we prove that modiﬁcations to a host’s
concrete state reﬁne changes to the protocol-layer state. The
delegation map, however, poses a challenge unique to IronKV.
The protocol layer uses an inﬁnite map with an entry for
every possible key. However, the implementation layer must
use concrete data types with bounded size and reasonable
performance. Thus, we implement and prove correct an
efﬁcient data structure in which each host keeps only a
compact list of key ranges, along with the identity of the host
responsible for each range. This complexity we introduce
for the sake of performance creates opportunities for bugs.
However, by establishing invariants about the data structure
(e.g., the ranges are kept in sorted order), we prove that it
reﬁnes the abstract inﬁnite map used by the protocol layer.
This lets us introduce this complex data structure without risk
of data loss or any other error.
5.3 Common Libraries
In developing IronRSL and IronKV, we have written and ver-
iﬁed several generic libraries useful for distributed systems.
Generic reﬁnement. A common task is proving that an op-
eration on concrete implementation-layer objects reﬁnes the
corresponding operation on protocol-layer objects. For exam-
ple, IronRSL’s implementation uses a map from uint64s
to IP addresses where the protocol uses a map from mathe-

matical integers to abstract node identiﬁers. In the proof, we
must show that removing an element from the concrete map
has the same effect on the abstract version.
To simplify such tasks, we have built a generic library for
reasoning about reﬁnement between common data structures,
such as sequences and maps. Given basic properties about
the relationship between the concrete types and the abstract
types, e.g., that the function mapping concrete map keys to
abstract maps keys is injective, the library shows that various
concrete map operations, such as element lookup, addition,
and removal, reﬁne the corresponding abstract operations.
Marshalling and parsing. All distributed systems need to
marshal and parse network packets, a tedious task prone to
bugs. Both tasks necessarily involve signiﬁcant interaction
with the heap, since packets are ultimately represented as ar-
rays of bytes. Unfortunately, even state-of-the-art veriﬁcation
tools struggle to verify heap operations (§6.2). Hence, we
have written and veriﬁed a generic grammar-based parser and
marshaller to hide this pain from developers. For each dis-
tributed system, the developer speciﬁes a high-level grammar
for her messages. To marshal or unmarshal, the developer
simply maps between her high-level structure and a generic
data structure that matches her grammar. The library handles
the conversion to and from a byte array.
As evidence for the library’s utility, we initially wrote
an IronRSL-speciﬁc library. This took a person-month, and
relatively little of this code would have been useful in other
contexts. Dissatisﬁed, we built the generic library. This
required several more weeks, but given the generic library,
adding the IronRSL-speciﬁc portions only required two hours;
the IronKV-speciﬁc portions required even less.
Collection Properties. Another common task for distributed
systems is reasoning about properties of sequences, sets,
maps, etc. For instance, many IronRSL operations require
reasoning about whether a set of nodes form a quorum.
Thus, we have developed a library proving many useful
relationships about such collections. For example, one lemma
proves that if two sets are related by an injective function,
then their sizes are the same.
6. Lessons Learned
We summarize additional lessons we learned, beyond us-
ing invariant quantiﬁer hiding (§3.3) and always-enabled ac-
tions (§4.2), useful for future developers of veriﬁed systems.
6.1 Use the Set of Sent Messages in Invariants
The IronFleet network model is monotonic: once a message
is sent, it is kept in a ghost state variable forever. This is
necessary to prove that the system behaves correctly even
if the network delivers messages arbitrarily late. Since the
set of messages can only grow, it is often easy to prove
invariants about it. In contrast, an invariant that reasons over
mutable host state is harder to prove. Thus, where possible,
it is useful to have invariants be properties only of the set of
messages sent so far, as is often done in proofs of security for
cryptographic protocols [8]. Essentially, the system’s network
model provides this set as a free “history variable” [1].
6.2 Model Imperative Code Functionally
Verifying imperative code is challenging compared with
verifying purely functional code, even when using a state-
of-the-art tool like Dafny that is designed for imperative
programs (§2.2). Thus, we found it proﬁtable to implement
the system in two stages. First, we develop an implementation
using immutable value (functional) types and show that it
reﬁnes the protocol layer. Avoiding heap reasoning simpliﬁes
the reﬁnement proof, but, it produces a slow implementation,
since it cannot exploit the performance of heap references.
In the second stage, we replace the value types with mutable
heap types, improving performance while solving only a
narrow veriﬁcation problem.
We apply this pattern in building IronRSL and IronKV;
e.g., the functional implementation manipulates IP addresses
as value types and the performant one uses references to OS
handles. This strategy takes advantage of Dafny’s support for
mixing functional programming and imperative programming
styles: we can ﬁrst run the functional code and measure its
performance, then optimize the performance-critical sections
into imperative heap-based code as needed. Using a language
without good functional programming support (such as C)
would have made it harder to pursue this strategy.
6.3 Use Automation Judiciously
Automated veriﬁcation tools reduce the human effort needed
to complete a proof, but they often require additional guid-
ance from the developer in order to ﬁnd a proof, or, equally
importantly, to ﬁnd a proof in a reasonable amount of time.
6.3.1 Automation Successes
In many cases, Dafny’s automated reasoning allows the
developer to write little or no proof annotation. For instance,
Dafny excels at automatically proving statements about linear
arithmetic. Also, its heuristics for dealing with quantiﬁers,
while imperfect, often produce proofs automatically.
Dafny can also prove more complex statements auto-
matically. For instance, the lemma proving that IronRSL’s
ImplNext always meets the reduction-enabling obligation
consists of only two lines: one for the precondition and one
for the postcondition. Dafny automatically enumerates all ten
possible actions and all of their subcases, and observes that
all of them produce I/O sequences satisfying the property.
Similarly, automated reasoning allows many invariant
proofs to be quite brief, by reasoning as follows: If the invari-
ant about a host’s state holds in step i but not i + 1, the host
must have taken some action. However, none of the actions
can cause the invariant to stop holding. Typically, this last
part requires no proof annotation as the veriﬁer can internally
enumerate all cases, even for IronRSL with its many compli-
cated actions. Sometimes the veriﬁer cannot handle a tricky
case automatically, in which case the developer must insert

proof annotations. However, even then, the developer need
not mention, let alone enumerate, the other cases.
6.3.2 Automation Challenges
Even the fastest automated veriﬁcation tools can take a long
time to explore a huge search space. By default, Dafny reveals
all predicate deﬁnitions to its SMT solver Z3, potentially
giving Z3 a large search space. For example, each distributed
protocol’s HostNext transitively includes almost every
other deﬁnition in the protocol. Similarly, message-parsing
code refers to a large tree of possible message types. Having
such big trees in scope exposes the SMT solver to a bounded
but still large search space, e.g., any mention of a state invokes
every predicate about states.
To keep veriﬁcation time manageable and avoid veriﬁer
timeouts, we use Dafny’s opaque attribute and reveal
directive to selectively hide irrelevant deﬁnitions from the
SMT solver, and reveal them only when needed to complete a
proof [21]. This leads to a more modular style of veriﬁcation.
In addition to hiding large deﬁnitions, we also useopaque
to hide logic features that are hard to automate. For example,
we mark recursive predicate deﬁnitions opaque to prevent the
solver from blindly unrolling the deﬁnitions too many times.
To provide greater ﬂexibility, we modify Dafny to also
support a fuel attribute for functions. Fuel controls how
many times the SMT solver may expand a function’s deﬁni-
tion. Giving a function zero fuel is equivalent to marking the
function opaque, while giving a fuel of ﬁve allows the solver
to unroll a recursive function up to ﬁve times. By allowing
the programmer to specify a function’s fuel at the scope of
a statement, method, class, module, or program, we allow
different portions of the code to be more or less aggressive
about revealing function deﬁnitions.
Formulas that make heavy use of quantiﬁers (forall and
exists) may also lead to timeouts because the SMT solver can
instantiate the quantiﬁers more than it needs to, depending
on which triggers the solver chooses to control instantiation.
In many places, we adopt coding styles that avoid quantiﬁers
(§3.3). In other places, when we ﬁnd the default triggers in
Dafny overly liberal, leading to too many instantiations, we
modify Dafny to use more cautious triggers. In some cases,
we also annotate our Dafny code with manual triggers to
reduce instantiations. In particularly problematic formulas,
such as chains of alternating quantiﬁers (e.g., for all X there
exists a Y such that for all Z...) and set comprehensions,
we mark the containing predicate opaque. Temporal logic
formulas can easily lead to alternating quantiﬁers, so we
deﬁne□ and ♦ to be opaque by default.
7. Evaluation
IronFleet’s premise is that automated veriﬁcation is a viable
engineering approach, ready for developing real distributed
systems. We evaluate that hypothesis by answering the follow-
ing questions: (1) How does veriﬁcation affect the develop-

ment of distributed systems? (2) How does the performance
of a veriﬁed system compare with an unveriﬁed one?
7.1 Developer Experience
To assess practicality, we evaluate the developer experience
as well as the effort required to produce veriﬁed systems.
The experience of producing veriﬁed software shares
some similarities with that of unveriﬁed software. Dafny
provides near-real-time IDE-integrated feedback. Hence, as
the developer writes a given method or proof, she typically
sees feedback in 1–10 seconds indicating whether the veriﬁer
is satisﬁed. To ensure the entire system veriﬁes, our build
system tracks dependencies across ﬁles and outsources, in
parallel, each ﬁle’s veriﬁcation to a cloud virtual machine.
Thus, while a full integration build done serially requires
approximately six hours, in practice, the developer rarely
waits more than 6–8 minutes, which is comparable to any
other large system integration build.
An IronFleet developer must write a formal trusted spec,
a distributed protocol layer, and proof annotations to help the
veriﬁer see the reﬁnements between them. Figure 12 quanti-
ﬁes this effort by reporting the amount of proof annotation
required for each layer of the system. We count all non-spec,
non-executable code as proof annotation; this includes, for
example, requires and ensures clauses, loop invariants, and
all lemmas and invocations thereof. Note that the high-level
trusted speciﬁcation for IronRSL is only 85 SLOC, and for
IronKV it is only 34, making them easy to inspect for correct-
ness. At the implementation layer, our ratio of proof annota-
tion to executable code is 3.6 to 1. We attribute this relatively
low ratio to our proof-writing techniques (§3.3,§4.1,§6) and
our automated tools (§6.3.1).
In total, developing the IronFleet methodology and apply-
ing it to build and verify two real systems required approxi-
mately 3.7 person-years.

In exchange for this effort, IronFleet produces a provably
correct implementation with desirable liveness properties. In-
deed, except for unveriﬁed components like our C# client,
both IronRSL (including replication, view changes, log trun-
cation, batching, etc.) as well as IronKV (including delegation
and reliable delivery) worked the ﬁrst time we ran them.
7.2 Performance of Veriﬁed Distributed Systems
A reasonable criticism of any new toolchain focused on veri-
ﬁcation is that its structure might impair runtime efﬁciency.
While we focus most of our energy on overcoming veriﬁca-
tion burdens, we also try to produce viable implementations.
Our IronRSL experiments run three replicas on three
separate machines, each equipped with an Intel Xeon L5630
2.13 GHz processor and 12 GB RAM, connected over a
1 Gbps network. Our IronKV experiments use two such
machines connected over a 10 Gbps network.
IronRSL. Workload is offered by 1–256 parallel client
threads, each making a serial request stream and measur-
ing latency. As an unveriﬁed baseline, we use the MultiPaxos
Go-based implementation from the EPaxos codebase [15, 45]
For both systems, we use the same application state machine:
it maintains a counter and it increments the counter for every
client request. Figure 13 summarizes our results. We ﬁnd that
IronRSL’s peak throughput is within 2.4× of the baseline.
IronKV. To measure the throughput and latency of IronKV,
we preload the server with 1000 keys, then run a client with
1–256 parallel threads; each thread generates a stream of Get
(or Set) requests in a closed loop. As an unveriﬁed baseline,
we use Redis [ 57], a popular key/value store written in C
and C++, with the client-side write buffer disabled. For both
systems, we use 64-bit unsigned integers as keys and byte
arrays of varying sizes as values. Figure 14 summarizes our
results. We ﬁnd that IronKV’s performance is competitive
with that of Redis.
As a ﬁnal note, in all our experiments the bottleneck was
the CPU (not the memory, disk, or network).
8. Discussion and Future Work
§7.1 shows that in exchange for strong guarantees (which
depend on several assumptions, per§2.5), IronFleet requires
considerably more developer effort. Furthermore, in our
experience, there is a distinct learning curve when bringing

aboard developers unfamiliar with writing veriﬁed code. Most
developers would prefer to use a language like C++, so
enabling that is an important topic of future work.
§7.2 shows that while our systems achieve respectable
performance, they do not yet match that of the unveriﬁed
baselines. Some of that gap stems directly from our use of
veriﬁcation. Verifying mutable data structures is challenging
(§6.2), and our measurements indicate that this is a signiﬁcant
bottleneck for our code. The baselines we compare against
have been highly optimized; we have also optimized our
code, but each optimization must be proven correct. Hence,
given a ﬁxed time budget, IronFleet will likely produce fewer
optimizations. IronFleet also pays a penalty for compiling to
C#, which imposes run-time overhead to enforce type safety
on code that provably does not need it.
More fundamentally, aiming for full veriﬁcation makes
it challenging to reuse existing libraries, e.g., for optimized
packet serialization. Before our previous [ 21] and current
work (§5.3), Dafny had no standard libraries, necessitating
signiﬁcant work to build them; more such work lies ahead.
While our systems are more full-featured than previous
work (§9), they still lack many standard features offered by
the unveriﬁed baselines. Some features, such as reconﬁgu-
ration in IronRSL, only require additional developer time.
Other features require additional veriﬁcation techniques; e.g.,
post-crash recovery requires reasoning about the effects of
machine crashes that wipe memory but not disk.
In future work, we aim to mechanically verify our reduc-
tion argument and prove that our implementation run its main
loop in bounded time [2], never exhausts memory, and never
reaches its overﬂow-prevention limit under reasonable condi-
tions, e.g., if it never performs more than 264 operations.
9. Related Work
9.1 Protocol Veriﬁcation
Distributed system protocols are known to be difﬁcult to
design correctly. Thus, a systems design is often accompanied
by a formal English proof of correctness, typically relegated
to a technical report or thesis. Examples include Paxos [55],
the BFT protocol for Byzantine fault tolerance [ 6, 7], the
reconﬁguration algorithm in SMART [23, 41], Raft [49, 50],
Zookeeper’s consistent broadcast protocol Zab [ 28, 29],
Egalitarian Paxos [44, 45], and the Chord DHT [62, 63].

However, paper proofs, no matter how formal, can con-
tain errors. Zane showed that the “provably correct” Chord
protocol, when subjected to Alloy abstract model checking,
maintains none of its published invariants [71]. Thus, some re-
searchers have gone further and generated machine-checkable
proofs. Kellom¨aki created a proof of the Paxos consensus pro-
tocol checked in PVS [30]. Lamport’s TLAPS proof system
has been used to prove safety, but not liveness, properties of
the BFT protocol [38]. In all such cases, the protocols proven
correct have been much smaller and simpler than ours. For
instance, Kellom¨aki’s and Lamport’s proofs concerned single-
instance Paxos and BFT, which make only one decision total.
9.2 Model Checking
Model checking exhaustively explores a system’s state space,
testing whether a safety property holds in every reachable
state. This combinatorial exploration requires that the system
be instantiated with ﬁnite, typically tiny, parameters. As
a result, a positive result provides only conﬁdence, not
proof of safety; furthermore, that conﬁdence depends on the
modeler’s wisdom in parameter selection. Model checking
has been applied to myriad systems including a Python
implementation of Paxos [26]; Mace implementations of a
variety of distributed systems [31]; and, via MODIST [69],
unmodiﬁed binaries of Berkeley DB, MPS Paxos, and the
PaciﬁcA primary-backup replication system.
Model checking scales poorly to complex distributed
specs [4]. Abstract interpretation can help with such scal-
ing but does not fundamentally eliminate model checking’s
limitations. For instance, Zave’s correction to Chord uses the
Alloy model checker but only to partially automate the proof
of a single necessary invariant [72].
9.3 System Veriﬁcation
The recent increase in the power of software veriﬁcation has
emboldened several research groups to use it to prove the
correctness of entire systems implementations. seL4 is a mi-
crokernel written in C [32], with full functional correctness
proven using the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover. mCertiKOS-
hyp [19] is a small veriﬁed hypervisor, whose veriﬁcation in
the Coq interactive proof assistant places a strong emphasis
on modularity and abstraction. ExpressOS [43] uses Dafny
to sanity-check a policy manager for a microkernel. Our Iron-
clad project [21] shows how to completely verify the security
of sensitive services all the way down to the assembly. Iron-
Fleet differs by verifying a distributed implementation rather
than code running on a single machine, and by verifying
liveness, as well as safety, properties.
Researchers have also begun to apply software veriﬁcation
to distributed systems. Ridge [58] proves the correctness of
a persistent message queue written in OCaml; however, his
system is substantially smaller in scale than ours and has no
proven liveness properties.
Schiper et al. [ 60] verify the correctness of a Paxos
implementation by building it in EventML [56] and proving
correctness, but not liveness, with the NuPRL prover [ 10].
However, they do not verify the state machine replication
layer of this Paxos implementation, only the consensus
algorithm, ignoring complexities such as state transfer. They
also make unclear assumptions about network behavior. In
contrast to our methodology, which exploits multiple levels
of abstraction and reﬁnement, the EventML approach posits
a language below which all code generation is automatic, and
above which a human can produce a one-to-one reﬁnement.
It is unclear if this approach will scale up to more complex
and diverse distributed systems.
In concurrent work, Wilcox et al. [67, 68] propose Verdi,
a compiler-inspired approach to building veriﬁed distributed
system implementations. With Verdi, the developer writes
and proves her system correct in Coq using a simpliﬁed
environment (e.g., a single-machine system with a perfectly
reliable network). Verdi’s veriﬁed system transformers then
convert the developer’s implementation into an equivalent
implementation that is robust in a more hostile environment;
their largest system transformer is an implementation of Raft
that adds fault tolerance. Compared with IronFleet, Verdi
offers a cleaner approach to composition. Unlike IronRSL,
at present Verdi’s Raft implementation does not support
veriﬁed marshalling and parsing, state transfer, log truncation,
dynamic view-change timeouts, a reply cache, or batching.
Also, Verdi does not prove any liveness properties.
10. Conclusion
The IronFleet methodology slices a system into speciﬁc lay-
ers to make veriﬁcation of practical distributed system im-
plementations feasible. The high-level spec gives the sim-
plest description of the system’s behavior. The protocol
layer deals solely with distributed protocol design; we con-
nect it to the spec using TLA+ [ 36] style veriﬁcation. At
the implementation layer, the programmer reasons about a
single-host program without worrying about concurrency.
Reduction and reﬁnement tie these individually-feasible
components into a methodology that scales to practically-
sized concrete implementations. This methodology admits
conventionally-structured implementations capable of pro-
cessing up to 18,200 requests/second (IronRSL) and 28,800
requests/second (IronKV), performance competitive with un-
veriﬁed reference implementations.
