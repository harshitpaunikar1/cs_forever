Interlude: Process API
ASIDE : I NTERLUDES
Interludes will cover more practical aspects of systems, inclu ding a par-
ticular focus on operating system APIs and how to use them. If you don ’t
like practical things, you could skip these interludes. But you should like
practical things, because, well, they are generally useful in real life; com-
panies, for example, don’t usually hire you for your non-practical s kills.
In this interlude, we discuss process creation in U NIX systems. U NIX
presents one of the most intriguing ways to create a new process wi th
a pair of system calls: fork() and exec(). A third routine, wait(),
can be used by a process wishing to wait for a process it has create d to
complete. We now present these interfaces in more detail, with a few
simple examples to motivate us. And thus, our problem:
CRUX : H OW TO CREATE AND CONTROL PROCESSES
What interfaces should the OS present for process creation and con -
trol? How should these interfaces be designed to enable powerful func-
tionality , ease of use, and high performance?
5.1 The fork() System Call
The fork() system call is used to create a new process [C63]. How-
ever, be forewarned: it is certainly the strangest routine you w ill ever
call1. More speciﬁcally , you have a running program whose code looks
like what you see in Figure 5.1; examine the code, or better yet, t ype it in
and run it yourself!
1Well, OK, we admit that we don’t know that for sure; who knows what routine s you
call when no one is looking? But fork() is pretty odd, no matter how unusual your routine-
calling patterns are.

Figure 5.1: Calling fork() (p1.c)
When you run this program (called p1.c), you’ll see the following:
prompt> ./p1
hello (pid:29146)
parent of 29147 (pid:29146)
child (pid:29147)
prompt>
Let us understand what happened in more detail in p1.c. When it
ﬁrst started running, the process prints out a hello message; i ncluded in
that message is its process identiﬁer , also known as a PID. The process
has a PID of 29146; in U NIX systems, the PID is used to name the process
if one wants to do something with the process, such as (for example ) stop
it from running. So far, so good.
Now the interesting part begins. The process calls the fork() system
call, which the OS provides as a way to create a new process. The od d
part: the process that is created is an (almost) exact copy of the calling pro-
cess. That means that to the OS, it now looks like there are two copies of
the program p1 running, and both are about to return from the fork()
system call. The newly-created process (called the child, in contrast to the
creating parent) doesn’t start running at main(), like you might expect
(note, the “hello” message only got printed out once); rather, it ju st comes
into life as if it had called fork() itself.

Figure 5.2: Calling fork() And wait() (p2.c)
You might have noticed: the child isn’t an exact copy . Speciﬁcally , al-
though it now has its own copy of the address space (i.e., its own priv ate
memory), its own registers, its own PC, and so forth, the value it r eturns
to the caller of fork() is different. Speciﬁcally , while the parent receives
the PID of the newly-created child, the child receives a retur n code of
zero. This differentiation is useful, because it is simple the n to write the
code that handles the two different cases (as above).
You might also have noticed: the output (of p1.c) is not deterministic.
When the child process is created, there are now two active proce sses in
the system that we care about: the parent and the child. Assumi ng we
are running on a system with a single CPU (for simplicity), then either
the child or the parent might run at that point. In our example (ab ove),
the parent did and thus printed out its message ﬁrst. In other ca ses, the
opposite might happen, as we show in this output trace:
prompt> ./p1
hello (pid:29146)
child (pid:29147)
parent of 29147 (pid:29146)
prompt>
The CPU scheduler, a topic we’ll discuss in great detail soon, deter-
mines which process runs at a given moment in time; because the s ched-
uler is complex, we cannot usually make strong assumptions about w hat

it will choose to do, and hence which process will run ﬁrst. This non-
determinism, as it turns out, leads to some interesting problems, par-
ticularly in multi-threaded programs ; hence, we’ll see a lot more non-
determinism when we study concurrency in the second part of the book.
5.2 The wait() System Call
So far, we haven’t done much: just created a child that prints out a
message and exits. Sometimes, as it turns out, it is quite useful for a
parent to wait for a child process to ﬁnish what it has been doing. This
task is accomplished with the wait() system call (or its more complete
sibling waitpid()); see Figure 5.2 for details.
In this example ( p2.c), the parent process calls wait() to block (i.e.,
delay its execution) until the child ﬁnishes executing. When the child is
done, the parent becomes unblocked, and wait() returns in the parent.
Adding a wait() call to the code above makes the output determin-
istic. Can you see why? Go ahead, think about it.
(waiting for you to think .... and done)
Now that you have thought a bit, here is the output:
prompt> ./p2
hello (pid:29266)
child (pid:29267)
parent of 29267 (rc_wait:29267) (pid:29266)
prompt>
With this code, we now know that the child will always print ﬁrst.
Why do we know that? Well, it might simply run ﬁrst, as before, an d
thus print before the parent. However, if the parent does happen to run
ﬁrst, it will immediately call wait(); this system call won’t return until
the child has run and exited 2. Thus, even when the parent runs ﬁrst, it
politely waits for the child to ﬁnish running, then wait() returns, and
then the parent prints its message.
5.3 Finally , The exec() System Call
A ﬁnal and important piece of the process creation API is the exec()
system call 3. This system call is useful when you want to run a program
that is different from the calling program. For example, callin g fork()
2There are a few cases where wait() returns before the child exits; read the man page
for more details, as always. And beware of any absolute and unquali ﬁed statements this book
makes, such as “the child will always print ﬁrst” or “U NIX is the best thing in the world, even
better than ice cream.”
3On Linux, there are six variants of exec(): execl(), execlp(), execle(),
execv(), execvp() , and execvpe(). Read the man pages to learn more.

Figure 5.3: Calling fork(), wait(), And exec() (p3.c)
in p2.c is only useful if you want to keep running copies of the same
program. However, often you want to run a different program; exec()
does just that (Figure 5.3).
In this example, the child process calls execvp() in order to run the
program wc, which is the word counting program. In fact, it runs wc on
the source ﬁle p3.c, thus telling us how many lines, words, and bytes are
found in the ﬁle:
prompt> ./p3
hello (pid:29383)
child (pid:29384)
29 107 1030 p3.c
parent of 29384 (rc_wait:29384) (pid:29383)
prompt>
The fork() system call is strange; its partner in crime, exec(), is not
so normal either. What it does: given the name of an executable (e .g., wc),
and some arguments (e.g., p3.c), it loads code (and static data) from that

TIP : G ETTING IT RIGHT (L AMPSON ’ S LAW)
As Lampson states in his well-regarded “Hints for Computer Syste ms
Design” [L83], “ Get it right . Neither abstraction nor simplicity is a sub-
stitute for getting it right.” Sometimes, you just have to do the r ight thing,
and when you do, it is way better than the alternatives. There ar e lots
of ways to design APIs for process creation; however, the combinati on
of fork() and exec() are simple and immensely powerful. Here, the
UNIX designers simply got it right. And because Lampson so often “got
it right”, we name the law in his honor.
executable and overwrites its current code segment (and curre nt static
data) with it; the heap and stack and other parts of the memory spa ce of
the program are re-initialized. Then the OS simply runs that p rogram,
passing in any arguments as the argv of that process. Thus, it does not
create a new process; rather, it transforms the currently runn ing program
(formerly p3) into a different running program ( wc). After the exec()
in the child, it is almost as if p3.c never ran; a successful call to exec()
never returns.
5.4 Why? Motivating The API
Of course, one big question you might have: why would we build
such an odd interface to what should be the simple act of creating a new
process? Well, as it turns out, the separation of fork() and exec() is
essential in building a U NIX shell, because it lets the shell run code after
the call to fork() but before the call to exec(); this code can alter the
environment of the about-to-be-run program, and thus enables a va riety
of interesting features to be readily built.
The shell is just a user program 4. It shows you a prompt and then
waits for you to type something into it. You then type a command (i.e .,
the name of an executable program, plus any arguments) into it; in most
cases, the shell then ﬁgures out where in the ﬁle system the exe cutable
resides, calls fork() to create a new child process to run the command,
calls some variant of exec() to run the command, and then waits for the
command to complete by calling wait(). When the child completes, the
shell returns from wait() and prints out a prompt again, ready for your
next command.
The separation of fork() and exec() allows the shell to do a whole
bunch of useful things rather easily . For example:
prompt> wc p3.c > newfile.txt
4And there are lots of shells; tcsh, bash, and zsh to name a few. You should pick one,
read its man pages, and learn more about it; all U NIX experts do.

In the example above, the output of the program wc is redirected into
the output ﬁle newfile.txt (the greater-than sign is how said redirec-
tion is indicated). The way the shell accomplishes this task is quite sim-
ple: when the child is created, before calling exec(), the shell (speciﬁ-
cally , the code executed in the child process) closes standard output and
opens the ﬁle newfile.txt. By doing so, any output from the soon-
to-be-running program wc is sent to the ﬁle instead of the screen (open
ﬁle descriptors are kept open across the exec() call, thus enabling this
behavior [SR05]).
Figure 5.4 (page 8) shows a program that does exactly this. The re ason
this redirection works is due to an assumption about how the operati ng
system manages ﬁle descriptors. Speciﬁcally , U NIX systems start looking
for free ﬁle descriptors at zero. In this case, STDOUT FILENO will be the
ﬁrst available one and thus get assigned when open() is called. Subse-
quent writes by the child process to the standard output ﬁle des criptor,
for example by routines such as printf(), will then be routed transpar-
ently to the newly-opened ﬁle instead of the screen.
Here is the output of running the p4.c program:
prompt> ./p4
prompt> cat p4.output
32 109 846 p4.c
prompt>
You’ll notice (at least) two interesting tidbits about this outpu t. First,
when p4 is run, it looks as if nothing has happened; the shell just prints
the command prompt and is immediately ready for your next command.
However, that is not the case; the program p4 did indeed call fork() to
create a new child, and then run the wc program via a call to execvp().
You don’t see any output printed to the screen because it has been r edi-
rected to the ﬁle p4.output. Second, you can see that when we cat the
output ﬁle, all the expected output from running wc is found. Cool, right?
UNIX pipes are implemented in a similar way , but with the pipe()
system call. In this case, the output of one process is connected to an in-
kernel pipe (i.e., queue), and the input of another process is connected
to that same pipe; thus, the output of one process seamlessly is us ed as
input to the next, and long and useful chains of commands can be st rung
together. As a simple example, consider looking for a word in a ﬁle, a nd
then counting how many times said word occurs; with pipes and the u til-
ities grep and wc, it is easy; just type grep -o foo file | wc -l
into the command prompt and marvel at the result.
Finally , while we just have sketched out the process API at a high level,
there is a lot more detail about these calls out there to be learned and
digested; we’ll learn more, for example, about ﬁle descriptors wh en we
talk about ﬁle systems in the third part of the book. For now, sufﬁce i t
to say that the fork()/exec() combination is a powerful way to create
and manipulate processes.

5.5 Process Control And Users
Beyond fork(), exec(), and wait(), there are a lot of other inter-
faces for interacting with processes in U NIX systems. For example, the
kill() system call is used to send signals to a process, including di-
rectives to pause, die, and other useful imperatives. For conve nience,
in most U NIX shells, certain keystroke combinations are conﬁgured to
deliver a speciﬁc signal to the currently running process; for example,
control-c sends a SIGINT (interrupt) to the process (normally terminating
it) and control-z sends a SIGTSTP (stop) signal thus pausing the process
in mid-execution (you can resume it later with a command, e.g., t he fg
built-in command found in many shells).
The entire signals subsystem provides a rich infrastructure to deliver
external events to processes, including ways to receive and p rocess those
signals within individual processes, and ways to send signal s to individ-

ASIDE : RTFM — R EAD THE MAN PAGES
Many times in this book, when referring to a particular system c all or
library call, we’ll tell you to read the manual pages , or man pages for
short. Man pages are the original form of documentation that exist on
UNIX systems; realize that they were created before the thing call ed the
web existed.
Spending some time reading man pages is a key step in the growth of
a systems programmer; there are tons of useful tidbits hidden in those
pages. Some particularly useful pages to read are the man pages for
whichever shell you are using (e.g., tcsh, or bash), and certainly for any
system calls your program makes (in order to see what return valu es and
error conditions exist).
Finally , reading the man pages can save you some embarrassment. When
you ask colleagues about some intricacy of fork(), they may simply
reply: “RTFM.” This is your colleagues’ way of gently urging you t o Read
The Man pages. The F in RTFM just adds a little color to the phrase ...
ual processes as well as entire process groups. To use this form of com-
munication, a process should use the signal() system call to “catch”
various signals; doing so ensures that when a particular signa l is deliv-
ered to a process, it will suspend its normal execution and run a p articu-
lar piece of code in response to the signal. Read elsewhere [SR05] to learn
more about signals and their many intricacies.
This naturally raises the question: who can send a signal to a p rocess,
and who cannot? Generally , the systems we use can have multiple people
using them at the same time; if one of these people can arbitraril y send
signals such as SIGINT (to interrupt a process, likely terminating it), the
usability and security of the system will be compromised. As a re sult,
modern systems include a strong conception of the notion of a user. The
user, after entering a password to establish credentials, log s in to gain
access to system resources. The user may then launch one or many p ro-
cesses, and exercise full control over them (pause them, kill th em, etc.).
Users generally can only control their own processes; it is the job of the
operating system to parcel out resources (such as CPU, memory , and disk)
to each user (and their processes) to meet overall system goals.
5.6 Useful Tools
There are many command-line tools that are useful as well. For exa m-
ple, using the ps command allows you to see which processes are run-
ning; read the man pages for some useful ﬂags to pass to ps. The tool top
is also quite helpful, as it displays the processes of the syste m and how
much CPU and other resources they are eating up. Humorously , many
times when you run it, top claims it is the top resource hog; perhaps it is

ASIDE : T HE SUPERUSER (R OOT )
A system generally needs a user who can administer the system, and is
not limited in the way most users are. Such a user should be able to k ill
an arbitrary process (e.g., if it is abusing the system in some w ay), even
though that process was not started by this user. Such a user should also
be able to run powerful commands such as shutdown (which, unsurpris-
ingly , shuts down the system). In UNIX -based systems, these special abil-
ities are given to the superuser (sometimes called root). While most users
can’t kill other users processes, the superuser can. Being root is much like
being Spider-Man: with great power comes great responsibility [ QI15].
Thus, to increase security (and avoid costly mistakes), it’s usually better
to be a regular user; if you do need to be root, tread carefully , as all of the
destructive powers of the computing world are now at your ﬁngertips .
a bit of an egomaniac. The command kill can be used to send arbitrary
signals to processes, as can the slightly more user friendly killall. Be
sure to use these carefully; if you accidentally kill your wind ow manager,
the computer you are sitting in front of may become quite difﬁcult t o use.
Finally , there are many different kinds of CPU meters you can us e to
get a quick glance understanding of the load on your system; for example,
we always keep MenuMeters (from Raging Menace software) running on
our Macintosh toolbars, so we can see how much CPU is being utilized
at any moment in time. In general, the more information about what i s
going on, the better.
5.7 Summary
We have introduced some of the APIs dealing with U NIX process cre-
ation: fork(), exec(), and wait(). However, we have just skimmed
the surface. For more detail, read Stevens and Rago [SR05], of cours e,
particularly the chapters on Process Control, Process Relationsh ips, and
Signals; there is much to extract from the wisdom therein.
While our passion for the UNIX process API remains strong, we should
also note that such positivity is not uniform. For example, a recen t pa-
per by systems researchers from Microsoft, Boston University , an d ETH
in Switzerland details some problems with fork(), and advocates for
other, simpler process creation APIs such as spawn() [B+19]. Read it,
and the related work it refers to, to understand this different vantage
point. While it’s generally good to trust this book, remember too tha t
the authors have opinions; those opinions may not (always) be as wide ly
shared as you might think.

• Each process has a name; in most systems, that name is a number
known as a process ID (PID).
• The fork() system call is used in U NIX systems to create a new pro-
cess. The creator is called the parent; the newly created process is
called the child. As sometimes occurs in real life [J16], the child
process is a nearly identical copy of the parent.
• The wait() system call allows a parent to wait for its child to com-
plete execution.
• The exec() family of system calls allows a child to break free from
its similarity to its parent and execute an entirely new progr am.
• A U NIX shell commonly uses fork(), wait(), and exec() to
launch user commands; the separation of fork and exec enables fea -
tures like input/output redirection, pipes, and other cool features,
all without changing anything about the programs being run.
• Process control is available in the form of signals, which can cause
jobs to stop, continue, or even terminate.
• Which processes can be controlled by a particular person is enca p-
sulated in the notion of a user; the operating system allows multiple
users onto the system, and ensures users can only control their own
processes.
• A superuser can control all processes (and indeed do many other
things); this role should be assumed infrequently and with cau tion
for security reasons.

This simulation homework focuses on fork.py, a simple process cre-
ation simulator that shows how processes are related in a single “f amil-
ial” tree. Read the relevant README for details about how to run t he
simulator.
Questions
1. Run ./fork.py -s 10 and see which actions are taken. Can you
predict what the process tree looks like at each step? Use the -c
ﬂag to check your answers. Try some different random seeds ( -s)
or add more actions ( -a) to get the hang of it.
2. One control the simulator gives you is the fork_percentage, con-
trolled by the -f ﬂag. The higher it is, the more likely the next ac-
tion is a fork; the lower it is, the more likely the action is an exit.
Run the simulator with a large number of actions (e.g., -a 100 )
and vary the fork_percentage from 0.1 to 0.9. What do you
think the resulting ﬁnal process trees will look like as the perc ent-
age changes? Check your answer with -c.
3. Now, switch the output by using the -t ﬂag (e.g., run ./fork.py
-t). Given a set of process trees, can you tell which actions were
taken?
4. One interesting thing to note is what happens when a child ex its;
what happens to its children in the process tree? To study this , let’s
create a speciﬁc example: ./fork.py -A a+b,b+c,c+d,c+e,c- .
This example has process ’a’ create ’b’, which in turn creates ’c’,
which then creates ’d’ and ’e’. However, then, ’c’ exits. What do
you think the process tree should like after the exit? What if you
use the -R ﬂag? Learn more about what happens to orphaned pro-
cesses on your own to add more context.
5. One last ﬂag to explore is the -F ﬂag, which skips intermediate
steps and only asks to ﬁll in the ﬁnal process tree. Run ./fork.py
-F and see if you can write down the ﬁnal tree by looking at the
series of actions generated. Use different random seeds to try t his a
few times.
6. Finally , use both -t and -F together. This shows the ﬁnal process
tree, but then asks you to ﬁll in the actions that took place. By look-
ing at the tree, can you determine the exact actions that took plac e?
In which cases can you tell? In which can’t you tell? Try some dif-
ferent random seeds to delve into this question.

ASIDE : C ODING HOMEWORKS
Coding homeworks are small exercises where you write code to run on
a real machine to get some experience with some basic operating s ystem
APIs. After all, you are (probably) a computer scientist, and th erefore
should like to code, right? If you don’t, there is always CS theory , b ut
that’s pretty hard. Of course, to truly become an expert, you have to
spend more than a little time hacking away at the machine; inde ed, ﬁnd
every excuse you can to write some code and see how it works. Spend
the time, and become the wise master you know you can be.
Homework (Code)
In this homework, you are to gain some familiarity with the process
management APIs about which you just read. Don’t worry – it’s even
more fun than it sounds! You’ll in general be much better off if you ﬁn d
as much time as you can to write some code, so why not start now?
Questions
1. Write a program that calls fork(). Before calling fork(), have the
main process access a variable (e.g., x) and set its value to some-
thing (e.g., 100). What value is the variable in the child process?
What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change
the value of x?
2. Write a program that opens a ﬁle (with the open() system call)
and then calls fork() to create a new process. Can both the child
and parent access the ﬁle descriptor returned by open()? What
happens when they are writing to the ﬁle concurrently , i.e., a t the
same time?
3. Write another program using fork(). The child process should
print “hello”; the parent process should print “goodbye”. You shoul d
try to ensure that the child process always prints ﬁrst; can you do
this without calling wait() in the parent?
4. Write a program that calls fork() and then calls some form of
exec() to run the program /bin/ls. See if you can try all of the
variants of exec(), including (on Linux) execl(), execle(),
execlp(), execv(), execvp(), and execvpe(). Why do
you think there are so many variants of the same basic call?
5. Now write a program that uses wait() to wait for the child process
to ﬁnish in the parent. What does wait() return? What happens if
you use wait() in the child?

6. Write a slight modiﬁcation of the previous program, this time us -
ing waitpid() instead of wait(). When would waitpid() be
useful?
7. Write a program that creates a child process, and then in the c hild
closes standard output (STDOUT_FILENO). What happens if the child
calls printf() to print some output after closing the descriptor?
8. Write a program that creates two children, and connects the s tan-
dard output of one to the standard input of the other, using the
pipe() system call.
