Scheduling: Proportional Share
In this chapter, we’ll examine a different type of scheduler kn own as a
proportional-share scheduler, also sometimes referred to as a fair-share
scheduler. Proportional-share is based around a simple concept: instead
of optimizing for turnaround or response time, a scheduler might in stead
try to guarantee that each job obtain a certain percentage of CPU time.
An excellent early example of proportional-share scheduling is found
in research by Waldspurger and Weihl [WW94], and is known as lottery
scheduling; however, the idea is certainly older [KL88]. The basic idea
is quite simple: every so often, hold a lottery to determine whic h process
should get to run next; processes that should run more often should b e
given more chances to win the lottery . Easy , no? Now, onto the detai ls!
But not before our crux:
CRUX : H OW TO SHARE THE CPU P ROPORTIONALLY
How can we design a scheduler to share the CPU in a proportional
manner? What are the key mechanisms for doing so? How effective ar e
they?
9.1 Basic Concept: Tickets Represent Your Share
Underlying lottery scheduling is one very basic concept: tickets, which
are used to represent the share of a resource that a process (or use r or
whatever) should receive. The percent of tickets that a process has repre-
sents its share of the system resource in question.
Let’s look at an example. Imagine two processes, A and B, and furth er
that A has 75 tickets while B has only 25. Thus, what we would like is for
A to receive 75% of the CPU and B the remaining 25%.
Lottery scheduling achieves this probabilistically (but not d eterminis-
tically) by holding a lottery every so often (say , every time slice). Holding
a lottery is straightforward: the scheduler must know how many tot al
tickets there are (in our example, there are 100). The schedul er then picks

TIP : U SE RANDOMNESS
One of the most beautiful aspects of lottery scheduling is its use of ran-
domness. When you have to make a decision, using such a randomized
approach is often a robust and simple way of doing so.
Random approaches have at least three advantages over more tradi tional
decisions. First, random often avoids strange corner-case behav iors that
a more traditional algorithm may have trouble handling. For examp le,
consider the LRU replacement policy (studied in more detail in a future
chapter on virtual memory); while often a good replacement algorit hm,
LRU attains worst-case performance for some cyclic-sequential work-
loads. Random, on the other hand, has no such worst case.
Second, random also is lightweight, requiring little state to t rack alter-
natives. In a traditional fair-share scheduling algorithm, t racking how
much CPU each process has received requires per-process accoun ting,
which must be updated after running each process. Doing so rand omly
necessitates only the most minimal of per-process state (e.g., t he number
of tickets each has).
Finally , random can be quite fast. As long as generating a random num-
ber is quick, making the decision is also, and thus random can be u sed
in a number of places where speed is required. Of course, the fas ter the
need, the more random tends towards pseudo-random.
a winning ticket, which is a number from 0 to 99 1. Assuming A holds
tickets 0 through 74 and B 75 through 99, the winning ticket simp ly de-
termines whether A or B runs. The scheduler then loads the state of that
winning process and runs it.
Here is an example output of a lottery scheduler’s winning ticket s:
63 85 70 39 76 17 29 41 36 39 10 99 68 83 63 62 43 0 49 12
Here is the resulting schedule:
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A
B B B B
As you can see from the example, the use of randomness in lottery
scheduling leads to a probabilistic correctness in meeting th e desired pro-
portion, but no guarantee. In our example above, B only gets to run 4 out
of 20 time slices (20%), instead of the desired 25% allocation. How ever,
the longer these two jobs compete, the more likely they are to achi eve the
desired percentages.
1Computer Scientists always start counting at 0. It is so odd to non-comp uter-types that
famous people have felt obliged to write about why we do it this way [D 82].

SCHEDULING : P ROPORTIONAL SHARE 3
TIP : U SE TICKETS TO REPRESENT SHARES
One of the most powerful (and basic) mechanisms in the design of lot tery
(and stride) scheduling is that of the ticket. The ticket is used to represent
a process’s share of the CPU in these examples, but can be applied much
more broadly . For example, in more recent work on virtual memory man-
agement for hypervisors, Waldspurger shows how tickets can be us ed to
represent a guest operating system’s share of memory [W02]. Thus , if you
are ever in need of a mechanism to represent a proportion of ownershi p,
this concept just might be ... (wait for it) ... the ticket.
9.2 Ticket Mechanisms
Lottery scheduling also provides a number of mechanisms to mani p-
ulate tickets in different and sometimes useful ways. One way is with
the concept of ticket currency. Currency allows a user with a set of tick-
ets to allocate tickets among their own jobs in whatever currency they
would like; the system then automatically converts said curren cy into the
correct global value.
For example, assume users A and B have each been given 100 ticke ts.
User A is running two jobs, A1 and A2, and gives them each 500 tic kets
(out of 1000 total) in A’s currency . User B is running only 1 job and gi ves
it 10 tickets (out of 10 total). The system converts A1’s and A2’s all ocation
from 500 each in A’s currency to 50 each in the global currency; si milarly ,
B1’s 10 tickets is converted to 100 tickets. The lottery is then h eld over the
global ticket currency (200 total) to determine which job runs.
User A -> 500 (A’s currency) to A1 -> 50 (global currency)
-> 500 (A’s currency) to A2 -> 50 (global currency)
User B -> 10 (B’s currency) to B1 -> 100 (global currency)
Another useful mechanism is ticket transfer. With transfers, a process
can temporarily hand off its tickets to another process. This abi lity is
especially useful in a client/server setting, where a clien t process sends
a message to a server asking it to do some work on the client’s behal f.
To speed up the work, the client can pass the tickets to the serv er and
thus try to maximize the performance of the server while the ser ver is
handling the client’s request. When ﬁnished, the server then transfers the
tickets back to the client and all is as before.
Finally , ticket inﬂation can sometimes be a useful technique. With
inﬂation, a process can temporarily raise or lower the number of tic kets
it owns. Of course, in a competitive scenario with processes that do not
trust one another, this makes little sense; one greedy process cou ld give
itself a vast number of tickets and take over the machine. Rathe r, inﬂation
can be applied in an environment where a group of processes trust on e
another; in such a case, if any one process knows it needs more CPU ti me,
it can boost its ticket value as a way to reﬂect that need to the sy stem, all
without communicating with any other processes.

Figure 9.1: Lottery Scheduling Decision Code
9.3 Implementation
Probably the most amazing thing about lottery scheduling is the s im-
plicity of its implementation. All you need is a good random number
generator to pick the winning ticket, a data structure to trac k the pro-
cesses of the system (e.g., a list), and the total number of ticke ts.
Let’s assume we keep the processes in a list. Here is an example c om-
prised of three processes, A, B, and C, each with some number of tic kets.
head Job:A
Tix:100
Job:B
Tix:50
Job:C
Tix:250 NULL
To make a scheduling decision, we ﬁrst have to pick a random number
(the winner) from the total number of tickets (400) 2 Let’s say we pick the
number 300. Then, we simply traverse the list, with a simple c ounter
used to help us ﬁnd the winner (Figure 9.1).
The code walks the process list, adding each ticket value to counter
until the value exceeds winner. Once that is the case, the current list el-
ement is the winner. With our example of the winning ticket bein g 300,
the following takes place. First, counter is incremented to 100 to ac-
count for A’s tickets; because 100 is less than 300, the loop continu es.
Then counter would be updated to 150 (B’s tickets), still less than 300
and thus again we continue. Finally , counter is updated to 400 (clearly
greater than 300), and thus we break out of the loop with current point-
ing at C (the winner).
2Surprisingly , as pointed out by Bj ¨orn Lindberg, this can be challenging to do
correctly; for more details, see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2509679/

To make this process most efﬁcient, it might generally be best t o or-
ganize the list in sorted order, from the highest number of ticket s to the
lowest. The ordering does not affect the correctness of the algorith m;
however, it does ensure in general that the fewest number of list itera-
tions are taken, especially if there are a few processes that pos sess most
of the tickets.
9.4 An Example
To make the dynamics of lottery scheduling more understandable , we
now perform a brief study of the completion time of two jobs competing
against one another, each with the same number of tickets (100) a nd same
run time (R, which we will vary).
In this scenario, we’d like for each job to ﬁnish at roughly the same
time, but due to the randomness of lottery scheduling, sometimes one job
ﬁnishes before the other. To quantify this difference, we deﬁn e a simple
fairness metric, F which is simply the time the ﬁrst job completes divided
by the time that the second job completes. For example, if R = 10 , and
the ﬁrst job ﬁnishes at time 10 (and the second job at 20), F = 10
20 = 0 .5.
When both jobs ﬁnish at nearly the same time, F will be quite close to 1.
In this scenario, that is our goal: a perfectly fair scheduler wou ld achieve
F = 1.
Figure 9.2 plots the average fairness as the length of the two job s (R)
is varied from 1 to 1000 over thirty trials (results are generat ed via the
simulator provided at the end of the chapter). As you can see from th e
graph, when the job length is not very long, average fairness can be quite
low. Only as the jobs run for a signiﬁcant number of time slices does the
lottery scheduler approach the desired fair outcome.

9.5 How To Assign Tickets?
One problem we have not addressed with lottery scheduling is: how
to assign tickets to jobs? This problem is a tough one, because of cou rse
how the system behaves is strongly dependent on how tickets are al lo-
cated. One approach is to assume that the users know best; in suc h a
case, each user is handed some number of tickets, and a user can a llocate
tickets to any jobs they run as desired. However, this solution is a non-
solution: it really doesn’t tell you what to do. Thus, given a set of job s,
the “ticket-assignment problem” remains open.
9.6 Stride Scheduling
You might also be wondering: why use randomness at all? As we saw
above, while randomness gets us a simple (and approximately corr ect)
scheduler, it occasionally will not deliver the exact right prop ortions, es-
pecially over short time scales. For this reason, Waldspurger in vented
stride scheduling, a deterministic fair-share scheduler [W95].
Stride scheduling is also straightforward. Each job in the syst em has
a stride, which is inverse in proportion to the number of tickets i t has. In
our example above, with jobs A, B, and C, with 100, 50, and 250 tick ets,
respectively , we can compute the stride of each by dividing some large
number by the number of tickets each process has been assigned. For
example, if we divide 10,000 by each of those ticket values, we ob tain
the following stride values for A, B, and C: 100, 200, and 40. We ca ll
this value the stride of each process; every time a process runs, we will
increment a counter for it (called its pass value) by its stride to track its
global progress.
The scheduler then uses the stride and pass to determine whic h pro-
cess should run next. The basic idea is simple: at any given tim e, pick
the process to run that has the lowest pass value so far; when you r un
a process, increment its pass counter by its stride. A pseudocode imple-
mentation is provided by Waldspurger [W95]:
curr = remove_min(queue); // pick client with min pass
schedule(curr); // run for quantum
curr->pass += curr->stride; // update pass using stride
insert(queue, curr); // return curr to queue
In our example, we start with three processes (A, B, and C), with stride
values of 100, 200, and 40, and all with pass values initially a t 0. Thus, at
ﬁrst, any of the processes might run, as their pass values are eq ually low.
Assume we pick A (arbitrarily; any of the processes with equal l ow pass
values can be chosen). A runs; when ﬁnished with the time slice , we
update its pass value to 100. Then we run B, whose pass value is t hen
set to 200. Finally , we run C, whose pass value is incremented t o 40. At
this point, the algorithm will pick the lowest pass value, which is C’s, and
run it, updating its pass to 80 (C’s stride is 40, as you recall). Then C will

run again (still the lowest pass value), raising its pass to 12 0. A will run
now, updating its pass to 200 (now equal to B’s). Then C will run tw ice
more, updating its pass to 160 then 200. At this point, all pass v alues are
equal again, and the process will repeat, ad inﬁnitum. Figure 9.3 traces
the behavior of the scheduler over time.
As we can see from the ﬁgure, C ran ﬁve times, A twice, and B just
once, exactly in proportion to their ticket values of 250, 100, and 50. Lot-
tery scheduling achieves the proportions probabilistically over time; stride
scheduling gets them exactly right at the end of each scheduli ng cycle.
So you might be wondering: given the precision of stride schedulin g,
why use lottery scheduling at all? Well, lottery scheduling ha s one nice
property that stride scheduling does not: no global state. Imagi ne a new
job enters in the middle of our stride scheduling example above; w hat
should its pass value be? Should it be set to 0? If so, it will monopoliz e
the CPU. With lottery scheduling, there is no global state per p rocess;
we simply add a new process with whatever tickets it has, updat e the
single global variable to track how many total tickets we have, a nd go
from there. In this way , lottery makes it much easier to incorpora te new
processes in a sensible manner.
9.7 The Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)
Despite these earlier works in fair-share scheduling, the cu rrent Linux
approach achieves similar goals in an alternate manner. The sc heduler,
entitled the Completely Fair Scheduler (or CFS) [J09], implements fair-
share scheduling, but does so in a highly efﬁcient and scalabl e manner.
To achieve its efﬁciency goals, CFS aims to spend very little t ime mak-
ing scheduling decisions, through both its inherent design and its clever
use of data structures well-suited to the task. Recent studie s have shown
that scheduler efﬁciency is surprisingly important; speciﬁ cally , in a study
of Google datacenters, Kanev et al. show that even after aggressi ve opti-
mization, scheduling uses about 5% of overall datacenter CPU time [K+15].
Reducing that overhead as much as possible is thus a key goal in mod ern
scheduler architecture.

Figure 9.4: CFS Simple Example
Basic Operation
Whereas most schedulers are based around the concept of a ﬁxed tim e
slice, CFS operates a bit differently . Its goal is simple: to fa irly divide a
CPU evenly among all competing processes. It does so through a simp le
counting-based technique known as virtual runtime (vruntime).
As each process runs, it accumulates vruntime. In the most basic
case, each process’s vruntime increases at the same rate, in proportion
with physical (real) time. When a scheduling decision occurs, CFS will
pick the process with the lowest vruntime to run next.
This raises a question: how does the scheduler know when to stop
the currently running process, and run the next one? The tension here is
clear: if CFS switches too often, fairness is increased, as CFS will ensure
that each process receives its share of CPU even over miniscule t ime win-
dows, but at the cost of performance (too much context switching); i f CFS
switches less often, performance is increased (reduced context switching),
but at the cost of near-term fairness.
CFS manages this tension through various control parameters. The
ﬁrst is sched
latency. CFS uses this value to determine how long one
process should run before considering a switch (effectively det ermining
its time slice but in a dynamic fashion). A typical sched latency value
is 48 (milliseconds); CFS divides this value by the number (n) of processes
running on the CPU to determine the time slice for a process, and t hus
ensures that over this period of time, CFS will be completely fair .
For example, if there are n = 4 processes running, CFS divides the
value of sched latency by n to arrive at a per-process time slice of 12
ms. CFS then schedules the ﬁrst job and runs it until it has used 12 ms
of (virtual) runtime, and then checks to see if there is a job wit h lower
vruntime to run instead. In this case, there is, and CFS would switch
to one of the three other jobs, and so forth. Figure 9.4 shows an examp le
where the four jobs (A, B, C, D) each run for two time slices in this fashion;
two of them (C, D) then complete, leaving just two remaining, wh ich then
each run for 24 ms in round-robin fashion.
But what if there are “too many” processes running? Wouldn’t that
lead to too small of a time slice, and thus too many context switche s?
Good question! And the answer is yes.
To address this issue, CFS adds another parameter,min granularity,
which is usually set to a value like 6 ms. CFS will never set the time slice
OPERATING
SYSTEMS
[V ERSION 1.10]
WWW.OSTEP .ORG

SCHEDULING : P ROPORTIONAL SHARE 9
of a process to less than this value, ensuring that not too much tim e is
spent in scheduling overhead.
For example, if there are ten processes running, our original cal cula-
tion would divide sched latency by ten to determine the time slice
(result: 4.8 ms). However, because of min granularity, CFS will set
the time slice of each process to 6 ms instead. Although CFS won’t (q uite)
be perfectly fair over the target scheduling latency ( sched latency) of
48 ms, it will be close, while still achieving high CPU efﬁcien cy .
Note that CFS utilizes a periodic timer interrupt, which means it can
only make decisions at ﬁxed time intervals. This interrupt goes off fre-
quently (e.g., every 1 ms), giving CFS a chance to wake up and d etermine
if the current job has reached the end of its run. If a job has a time slice
that is not a perfect multiple of the timer interrupt interval, that is OK;
CFS tracks vruntime precisely , which means that over the long haul, it
will eventually approximate ideal sharing of the CPU.
Weighting (Niceness)
CFS also enables controls over process priority , enabling users or admin-
istrators to give some processes a higher share of the CPU. It does t his
not with tickets, but through a classic U NIX mechanism known as the
nice level of a process. The nice parameter can be set anywhere from -2 0
to +19 for a process, with a default of 0. Positive nice values impl y lower
priority and negative values imply higher priority; when you’re too nice,
you just don’t get as much (scheduling) attention, alas.
CFS maps the nice value of each process to a weight, as shown here:
static const int prio_to_weight[40] = {
/* -20 */ 88761, 71755, 56483, 46273, 36291,
/* -15 */ 29154, 23254, 18705, 14949, 11916,
/* -10 */ 9548, 7620, 6100, 4904, 3906,
/* -5 */ 3121, 2501, 1991, 1586, 1277,
/* 0 */ 1024, 820, 655, 526, 423,
/* 5 */ 335, 272, 215, 172, 137,
/* 10 */ 110, 87, 70, 56, 45,
/* 15 */ 36, 29, 23, 18, 15,
};
These weights allow us to compute the effective time slice of eac h pro-
cess (as we did before), but now accounting for their priority diff erences.
The formula used to do so is as follows, assuming n processes:
time
slicek = weightk∑n−1
i=0 weighti
· sched latency (9.1)
Let’s do an example to see how this works. Assume there are two
jobs, A and B. A, because it’s our most precious job, is given a higher pri-

PIECES

10 S CHEDULING : P ROPORTIONAL SHARE
ority by assigning it a nice value of -5; B, because we hates it 3, just has the
default priority (nice value equal to 0). This means weightA (from the ta-
ble) is 3121, whereas weightB is 1024. If you then compute the time slice
of each job, you’ll ﬁnd that A’s time slice is about 3
4 of sched latency
(hence, 36 ms), and B’s about 1
4 (hence, 12 ms).
In addition to generalizing the time slice calculation, the wa y CFS cal-
culates vruntime must also be adapted. Here is the new formula, which
takes the actual run time that process i has accrued (runtimei) and scales
it inversely by the weight of the process, by dividing the defau lt weight
of 1024 ( weight0) by its weight, weighti. In our running example, A’s
vruntime will accumulate at one-third the rate of B’s.
vruntimei = vruntimei + weight0
weighti
· runtimei (9.2)
One smart aspect of the construction of the table of weights above is
that the table preserves CPU proportionality ratios when the difference in
nice values is constant. For example, if process A instead had a n ice value
of 5 (not -5), and process B had a nice value of 10 (not 0), CFS would
schedule them in exactly the same manner as before. Run through the
math yourself to see why .
Using Red-Black T rees
One major focus of CFS is efﬁciency , as stated above. For a schedule r,
there are many facets of efﬁciency , but one of them is as simple as this:
when the scheduler has to ﬁnd the next job to run, it should do so a s
quickly as possible. Simple data structures like lists don’t sca le: modern
systems sometimes are comprised of 1000s of processes, and thus se arch-
ing through a long-list every so many milliseconds is wasteful.
CFS addresses this by keeping processes in a red-black tree [B72]. A
red-black tree is one of many types of balanced trees; in contrast to a
simple binary tree (which can degenerate to list-like perfor mance un-
der worst-case insertion patterns), balanced trees do a littl e extra work
to maintain low depths, and thus ensure that operations are logar ithmic
(and not linear) in time.
CFS does not keep all processes in this structure; rather, only running
(or runnable) processes are kept therein. If a process goes to sle ep (say ,
waiting on an I/O to complete, or for a network packet to arrive), it is
removed from the tree and kept track of elsewhere.
Let’s look at an example to make this more clear. Assume there are t en
jobs, and that they have the following values of vruntime: 1, 5, 9, 10, 14,
18, 17, 21, 22, and 24. If we kept these jobs in an ordered list, ﬁn ding the
next job to run would be simple: just remove the ﬁrst element. Howe ver,
3Yes, yes, we are using bad grammar here on purpose, please don’t s end in a bug ﬁx.
Why? Well, just a most mild of references to the Lord of the Rings, and ou r favorite anti-hero
Gollum, nothing to get too excited about.

when placing that job back into the list (in order), we would have to scan
the list, looking for the right spot to insert it, an O(n) operation. Any
search is also quite inefﬁcient, also taking linear time on av erage.
Keeping the same values in a red-black tree makes most operation s
more efﬁcient, as depicted in Figure 9.5. Processes are ordered in the tree
by vruntime, and most operations (such as insertion and deletion) are
logarithmic in time, i.e., O(log n). When n is in the thousands, logarith-
mic is noticeably more efﬁcient than linear.
Dealing With I/O And Sleeping Processes
One problem with picking the lowest vruntime to run next arises with
jobs that have gone to sleep for a long period of time. Imagine two pro-
cesses, A and B, one of which (A) runs continuously , and the other (B )
which has gone to sleep for a long period of time (say , 10 seconds). Wh en
B wakes up, its vruntime will be 10 seconds behind A’s, and thus (if
we’re not careful), B will now monopolize the CPU for the next 10 sec-
onds while it catches up, effectively starving A.
CFS handles this case by altering the vruntime of a job when it wakes
up. Speciﬁcally , CFS sets the vruntime of that job to the minimum value
found in the tree (remember, the tree only contains running jobs) [B+18].
In this way , CFS avoids starvation, but not without a cost: jobs that sleep
for short periods of time frequently do not ever get their fair shar e of the
CPU [AC97].
Other CFS Fun
CFS has many other features, too many to discuss at this point in t he
book. It includes numerous heuristics to improve cache performan ce, has
strategies for handling multiple CPUs effectively (as discussed later in the

TIP : U SE EFFICIENT DATA STRUCTURES WHEN APPROPRIATE
In many cases, a list will do. In many cases, it will not. Knowing w hich
data structure to use when is a hallmark of good engineering. In t he case
discussed herein, simple lists found in earlier schedulers s imply do not
work well on modern systems, particular in the heavily loaded ser vers
found in datacenters. Such systems contain thousands of active pr o-
cesses; searching through a long list to ﬁnd the next job to run on e ach
core every few milliseconds would waste precious CPU cycles. A be tter
structure was needed, and CFS provided one by adding an excelle nt im-
plementation of a red-black tree. More generally , when picking a data
structure for a system you are building, carefully consider its access pat-
terns and its frequency of usage; by understanding these, you w ill be able
to implement the right structure for the task at hand.

9.8 Summary
We have introduced the concept of proportional-share scheduling a nd
brieﬂy discussed three approaches: lottery scheduling, stri de scheduling,
and the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) of Linux. Lottery uses ran dom-
ness in a clever way to achieve proportional share; stride does so deter-
ministically . CFS, the only “real” scheduler discussed in thi s chapter, is a
bit like weighted round-robin with dynamic time slices, but bu ilt to scale
and perform well under load; to our knowledge, it is the most widely
used fair-share scheduler in existence today .
No scheduler is a panacea, and fair-share schedulers have th eir fair
share of problems. One issue is that such approaches do not partic ularly
mesh well with I/O [AC97]; as mentioned above, jobs that perform I /O
occasionally may not get their fair share of CPU. Another issue is t hat
they leave open the hard problem of ticket or priority assignment, i.e.,
how do you know how many tickets your browser should be allocated, or
to what nice value to set your text editor? Other general-purpos e sched-
ulers (such as the MLFQ we discussed previously , and other similar Linux
schedulers) handle these issues automatically and thus may b e more eas-
ily deployed.
The good news is that there are many domains in which these prob-
lems are not the dominant concern, and proportional-share schedul ers
are used to great effect. For example, in a virtualized data center (or
cloud), where you might like to assign one-quarter of your CPU cycles
to the Windows VM and the rest to your base Linux installation, pr opor-
tional sharing can be simple and effective. The idea can also b e extended
to other resources; see Waldspurger [W02] for further details on how to
proportionally share memory in VMWare’s ESX Server.

Homework (Simulation)
This program, lottery.py, allows you to see how a lottery scheduler
works. See the README for details.
Questions
1. Compute the solutions for simulations with 3 jobs and random seeds
of 1, 2, and 3.
2. Now run with two speciﬁc jobs: each of length 10, but one (job 0)
with 1 ticket and the other (job 1) with 100 (e.g., -l 10:1,10:100 ).
What happens when the number of tickets is so imbalanced? Will
job 0 ever run before job 1 completes? How often? In general, what
does such a ticket imbalance do to the behavior of lottery schedul -
ing?
3. When running with two jobs of length 100 and equal ticket alloc a-
tions of 100 (-l 100:100,100:100 ), how unfair is the scheduler?
Run with some different random seeds to determine the (probabilis-
tic) answer; let unfairness be determined by how much earlier one
job ﬁnishes than the other.
4. How does your answer to the previous question change as the quan-
tum size ( -q) gets larger?
5. Can you make a version of the graph that is found in the chapter?
What else would be worth exploring? How would the graph look
with a stride scheduler?
